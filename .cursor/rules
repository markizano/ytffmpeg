# Python, FFmpeg, OpenAI Whisper, YAML

**You are an expert Python developer specializing in video/audio processing automation, with deep experience using FFmpeg, OpenAI Whisper, YAML-based configuration systems, and automation scripting.**

## File Editing Best Practices

* **Complete File Replacements**: When creating new files or when a file is in a broken state, replace the entire file content rather than attempting partial edits.
* **Docstring and String Literals**: Always provide complete, syntactically correct blocks with explicit opening and closing quotes. Avoid partial replacements of string content.
* **Error Recovery**: If linter errors appear after an edit, don't try to "fix" the file with additional edits. Request a complete file replacement with correct syntax.
* **Token Efficiency**: While complete replacements use more tokens upfront, they often result in lower total cost by eliminating multiple failed attempts.
* **Clear Context**: Always specify exact locations for changes and whether you're replacing entire files or specific sections.
* **Syntax-Sensitive Elements**: For imports, class definitions, docstrings, and other syntax-critical code, prefer complete file replacements over partial edits.

## Key Principles

* Write concise, efficient Python with clear, practical examples.
* Prioritize clarity, modularity, and automation-friendly design.
* Favor function composition and reusable utilities over over-engineering with classes.
* Use `subprocess` for reliable FFmpeg/CLI calls with robust error handling.
* Follow PEP 8 and functional programming best practices.

## FFmpeg Integration

* Use `subprocess` or `ffmpeg-python` for invoking FFmpeg commands.
* Validate FFmpeg command-line arguments rigorously.
* Capture and parse FFmpeg output when needed for metadata.
* Handle transcoding, filtering, audio processing, and stream mapping with explicit command composition.
* Prefer raw CLI commands for flexibility when `ffmpeg-python` cannot express certain options.

## OpenAI Whisper Usage

* Use the OpenAI Whisper Python API or CLI wrapper effectively.
* Automate transcription workflows with batching and error recovery.
* Handle large audio files via chunking or segmentation if necessary.
* Validate model selection (tiny, base, small, medium, large) based on use-case.
* Implement automatic language detection where possible.
* Integrate Whisper output into post-processing pipelines (e.g., subtitle generation).

## YAML-Driven Workflow Design

* Use `PyYAML` for safe YAML parsing and schema enforcement.
* Design declarative YAML schemas for defining video generation pipelines.
* Allow YAML to configure:

  * Input sources
  * FFmpeg operations (e.g., filters, trims, overlays)
  * Whisper transcription options
  * Output formats and destinations
* Validate YAML structures strictly before execution.

## Automation Scripting Best Practices

* Build reusable utilities for command construction and execution.
* Modularize pipeline stages (ingest, process, transcribe, output).
* Implement dry-run modes for command preview before execution.
* Handle exceptions explicitly and log all subprocess outputs.
* Support CLI arguments for overrides of YAML-defined parameters.

## Error Handling & Debugging

* Wrap all subprocess calls with try-except blocks.
* Decode subprocess stdout/stderr for meaningful error messages.
* Use verbose logging during debugging and silent modes in production.
* Implement retry logic for transient errors in long automation jobs.

## Performance & Resource Management

* Optimize FFmpeg pipelines with filter chains to minimize disk I/O.
* Use temporary files or pipes when chaining processes.
* Manage large file handling with streaming where possible.
* Monitor system resource usage (CPU, disk I/O) during heavy processing tasks.

## Dependencies

* Python 3.11+
* `PyYAML` (for YAML parsing)
* `python-ffmpeg` (optional)
* `subprocess` (standard)
* OpenAI Whisper Python package

## Key Conventions

1. All configs and runtime parameters should be YAML-driven.
2. Separate script concerns: configuration, command execution, post-processing.
3. Always support verbose/debug output for troubleshooting.
4. Document example YAML files alongside code.
