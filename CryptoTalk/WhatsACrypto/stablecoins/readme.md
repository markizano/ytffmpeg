# TikTok Opening

Let's talk about Stablecoins!

# YouTube Opening
Greetings and welcome to Kizano's CryptoTalk!
My name is Markizano Draconus, but that is a pen-name for another time. I am here to help you 
understand cryptocurrency theory. Before we get into today's video, there's a disclaimer I must 
declare in order to make you aware. Nothing in this video is financial advice because I'm just 
helping you understand concepts to help you be successful in learning and investing in crypto. What 
I talk about in my videos is for edutainment purposes only. Time is of the essence here, so for the 
parts you already know, you can jump ahead. However, watching the whole way through means a lot to 
me.

With that out of the way, let's talk about these stablecoins!

# Preface
Before we get into the definitions and details, a little metadata about this video:

First off: I am not a fan of folks who say you can find this in the description below and don't give
any other direction than that. When you open the video description, it's full of a bunch of links, text
and content that makes it difficult to find the information for which you are searching. Let's see if
I can start a trend among YouTubers. Anytime I say that you can find a link in the description below,
I'll include a hashtag you can use to search for that link specifically to make it easier to find
in the wall of text.

Secondly, I thought this was going to be simple coverage over 3 stablecoins, but it turns out
there are several out there. So in this video, I will be covering the top most well-known stablecoins
that are pegged to the USD. I am aware that there are other stablecoins that are pegged to other
assets and securities; these stablecoins will be omitted from coverage in this video.
I also discovered several other niche stablecoins that /are/ backed by the USD, however, I was unable
to find much of verifiable information on them, so they too will be ommitted from this video.

Perhaps in a future video, I can provide an extension to this video with additional coverage
once I am able to compile a decent amount of information to present to you. Let me know in the comments
below if you want additional coverage on alternate Stablecoins.

In this video, we'll be covering USDC, USDT, GUSD, BUSD and DAI.

# What's a Stablecoin?
Stablecoins are just that: Coins that are stable like a horse!
Stablecoins are pegged a dollar which is used to back them. They are intended to be stable
in price and do not fluxuate like other cryptocurrencies. Often times, they are the gateway into
other crypto projects.

From a retail investor perspective, I highly recommend Stablecoins to those new to cryptocurrency
because there's so much to be done with them at a fraction of the risk of other cryptocurrencies.

Relatively speaking: The fluxuation in price of a stablecoin is sub-penny. The price may fluxuate a
fraction of a cent to maybe 2 pennies, but for the most part: 1 stablecoin == 1 USD.

Now, there is a risk factor I do need to disclose: this risk applies to stablecoins just like it 
does the banks. If there's a run on the banks and everyone goes to cash out their accounts at the 
same time and the bank doesn't have the funds to provide everyone with cash, this will be a 
liquidity crash. Not everyone is going to get their cash. Same thing with the stablecoins: If 
everyone goes to cash in their crypto at the same time and flee to stablecoins, there will be a 
liquidity crash and thus this will crash the price of the stablecoin.

When you goto an exchange to purchase stablecoins, you'll be giving them your USD and exchanging them
for a digital version of it. You'll give the exchange your $1 and they will mint for you a brand new
stablecoin you can use in your cryptocurrency journey.

When you want to cash out, you give your stablecoins to the exchange and they will make a deposit
into your account for the equivalent amount and the digital coins you used to pay for this will be
burnt, or sent to an address nobody has access because the private keys were destroyed upon creation.

# Term Check: ERC-20
I'm going to throw some terms at you and I don't want you to miss out on the goodies!
ERC stands for Ethereum Request for Comment. It was used mostly on the Githubs when someone came 
out with a proposal to change something on the Ethereum network. They would request for someone to 
comment on it and it would be used as the guilelines for the upcoming change if it was accepted and 
coded into the Ethereum network. Those of you that work in software development know that you need
to have a process by which changes can make it into the codebase. You can think of ERC proposals
as formal CR or Change Requests.
ERC-20 referrs to the instructions on what a token is.

You can find more about that using the [link](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-20/)
in the description below as #ERC20.

And, if you found this little tidbit helpful, smash that like button for the YouTube algorithm so 
others learn these goodies too ;)

# Term Check: Commercial Paper
In this video, there's going to be a lot of talk about this "Commercial Paper" - I had to lookup
the term myself. According to [investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/commercialpaper.asp),
it's a form of debt that's not usually backed by collateral. It's limited only to those with the highest
of credit rankings. There is a minimum withdrawal amounts over six figures. It's short-term unsecured debt.
To find out more, you can read the post linked in the description as #CommercialPaper.

# USDC
USDC is provided by Circle as an ERC20 token. This means it's a token on the Ethereum network that 
is pegged to the USD. It's backed dollar for dollar which means for each dollar you buy with this 
stablecoin - it has an equivalent amount of cash available in its reserves. Coinbase typically 
let's you buy this coin without imposing any conversion fees. According to their website, Circle
undergoes monthly audits of its holdings. However, when viewing the reports from their site myself,
it just simply appears to be a signed document stating their current circulating supply.
More about that can be found on their website. Link will be in the description as [#USDC](https://www.circle.com/en/usdc).

USDC is backed by:
- 61% Cash and Gov't MoneyMarket Funds.
- 13% Yankee CD's, which are Certificates of Deposit issued by Foreign bank branches.
- 12% US Treasury Bonds.
- 9% Commercial Paper.
- 5% Corporate Bonds.

You can find out more about my sources on this using the link in the description as
[#LedgerInsights](https://www.ledgerinsights.com/circle-publishes-details-of-usdc-stablecoin-asset-backing/).
This information was published in July of 2021.

# USDT
USDT is provided by Tether. Tether's whitepaper and slogan says "Fiat currencies on the Bitcoin 
Blockchain." It uses Proof of Reserves to back its holdings. Tether is available on the Ethereum 
network as an ERC-20 token along with many other blockchains. It's supported on many trading 
pairs. Personally, I often see far much support for USDT trading pairs than any other stablecoin 
mentioned in this video, but that's just my exposure.
As of August of 2021, according to a post by The Block,
Tether's asset backing is as follows:
- 85% Cash, Cash equivalents, short-term deposits and more of that Commercial Paper.
- 8% in Corporate Bonds, Funds & Precious Metals.
- 4% in secured loans with unknown entities.
- 3% in other investments including digital tokens.

You can find out more about this using the link in the description as
[#TheBlock](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/113874/tether-new-reserves-report-june-2021-treasury-bills).

# GUSD
GUSD is provided by Gemini, which was founded by the Winklevoss twins! To quote their website:
"Gemini is a U.S. company 
regulated by the New York Department of Financial Services. GUSD reserves are eligible for FDIC 
insurance up to $250,000 per user while custodied with State Street Bank and Trust" as per their
[website](https://www.gemini.com/dollar). It is also available as an ERC-20 token.
I was unable to find any reports related to how much of what is allocated in their reserves.
Please do comment below if you can find any credible sources for this information and I'll include
it in an update in a future video.

# BUSD
BUSD is provided by Paxos in partnership with Binance. BUSD is provided as a BEP-20 token on the
BSC or the Binance Smart Chain. I was able to find the official report from Paxos about their backing,
however, it does not break down how much of this backing is held by which kinds of cash equivalents
behind BUSD.

You can find out more about BUSD's backing by following the link in the description as
[#Paxos](https://paxos.com/attestations/).

# DAI
DAI is the closest thing we have to a decentralized stablecoin. It was created and provided by MakerDAO.
MakerDAO is a Decentralized Autonomous Organization. To quote from the whitepaper:
"The Dai stablecoin is a decentralized, unbiased, collateral-backed cryptocurrency soft-pegged to
the US Dollar."

Now, there isn't an official report done on regular intervals related to the backing of DAI because
it is decentralized. There have been applications built on top of Ethereum to help us collect and render
this information in a browser-based application.
You can view these utilities and the data they provide by navigating to
https://makerburn.com and https://daistats.com.

Both will be linked in the description as #DAI

# My Experience
In my experience, I don't see anything significantly different among these coins that means I need
to be concerned which stablecoin I'm holding. To me: A stablecoin is a stablecoin and they all make
interest.

Personally, when I want to build a cash position, I buy GUSD or USDC and store them with BlockFi.
You can consider BlockFi to be your savings account by getting up to 9% in interest just for holding
your money there. That 9% stacks up quick against inflation!

Get up to $150 when you fund your account using my link: markizano.net/blockfi
I embedded their complex referral code in a redirect from my website to make it easy to access the
platform and avoid having to remember or type in some complex referral code.
So, when you visit my site, it will immediately redirect you to BlockFi's website, but includes
that referral code they gave me (until I get a sponsorship from them).

# Summary
This is just a pointer to a resource. You do with your money what you want be it Coinbase, Gemini,
Kraken or whatever exchange you want to use.
If I introduced this to you and you're seriously considering it, using the link will be a great way
to say thank you :)
