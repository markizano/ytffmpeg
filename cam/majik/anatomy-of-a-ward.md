The Anatomy of a Ward

I see a lot of how-to videos and titles on how to cast wards, but I don't see many trying to break
down the general scope of things from a more general understanding that is the essence behind the
castings. Not to say one is better than the other, but to explore a more generalistic perspective to
better understand the common denominator among many styles and types of proection and ward-like spells.

The Ward Strength is in your Emotions
The wards are powered by your emotions towards certain things and will respond according to your desires.
So this means take care in how you judge your friends or how you operate at work. Think carefully
about what drives your desires for certain people and things to be around you. I find it easier to
instead focus on six main traits you are looking for in people and attract yourself to them by
leading by example.

You are the average of your top five friends.

Once you have established your base of things you stand for, then you will start to build a strength
for each of them and an affinity for the abilities they grant you. Yes, your wards may become sentient
and start to communicate with you on a very fundamental or primal level.
