1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.440
All right, I was gonna wait until

2
00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:03.840
this was finished before I told the

3
00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:04.560
story about it

4
00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:06.380
But cat's out of the bag, you

5
00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:07.020
already know it's here

6
00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:08.980
So I can go ahead and tell

7
00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:09.860
you what this means now

8
00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:11.740
And I can always remake this video

9
00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:13.220
once I finally get the coloring finished

10
00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:14.500
in. This is incomplete

11
00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:16.200
I will go back in December so

12
00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:17.460
that I can have this finished off.

13
00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:19.260
But what is it? And what does

14
00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:19.920
it mean to me?

15
00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:23.700
My name is Markizano Draconus and

16
00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:25.200
that's the alias I go by on

17
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:25.540
the internet

18
00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:27.900
Everybody should know me by this name

19
00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.460
by now because this is the story

20
00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:30.260
that I need to tell

21
00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:34.060
This is called an Altrish

22
00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:36.040
It is a symbol and a sigil

23
00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:38.220
that I have created to represent me

24
00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:40.220
and everything it is I stand for.

25
00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:44.100
The gold bars represents the foundations

26
00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.200
upon which we stand the light that

27
00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.320
is contained within us all and

28
00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:50.460
That upon which we may use as

29
00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.360
a platform to ascend

30
00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:54.960
It starts off in the darkness where

31
00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.880
we are all shrouded in mystery, unknowing,

32
00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:59.760
as we enter into this world and

33
00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:00.640
cross into that veil

34
00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:02.900
whatever that is and

35
00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:05.300
Oftentimes just like a seed placed

36
00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:05.980
into the ground

37
00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:08.200
Sometimes you just need to continue

38
00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:11.040
moving and continue trudging forward

39
00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.380
and keep ascending until you reach

40
00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:13.980
the light

41
00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:16.940
Which is the enlightenment. The colors

42
00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:19.900
represents the purple and the blue

43
00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:20.840
to represent

44
00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:23.960
The crown and the third eye respectively

45
00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:26.340
of the chakras that are oftentimes

46
00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.620
Suppressed in order to keep us in

47
00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:29.660
this survival state

48
00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.680
the arrow pointing up represents the

49
00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:34.300
ascendance that is available to us

50
00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:35.860
all and also

51
00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:37.340
it

52
00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:40.920
It just asserts that belief that I

53
00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.620
have within me that

54
00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:45.440
Every single human being has value

55
00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:47.900
and that this is applicable to all

56
00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:48.300
of us

57
00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:49.780
This is

58
00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:52.240
It's a

59
00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:54.140
culmination of a unique hand sign

60
00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:54.940
that I had created

61
00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:56.940
Way back when I was like 7-8

62
00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:58.600
years old as I was trying

63
00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.640
to piece together what unique symbol

64
00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:02.360
sigil something

65
00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:04.540
Whatever can I use that represents

66
00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:06.780
me and this is what I came

67
00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.560
up with and this is what came back

68
00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:10.500
And I've been using this for years

69
00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:12.440
So even though it looks like a

70
00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:14.260
crypto whatever... Welcome. You must

71
00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:14.800
be new here

72
00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:16.960
This has been around since I was

73
00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:17.740
like 7-8 years old

74
00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:19.600
I have paper documents that I've been

75
00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:21.320
writing since school that I've got

76
00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:22.200
this sigil on it

77
00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.240
so this is basically a representation

78
00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:27.740
of that the ascendance that is available

79
00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:30.740
to us all to reach whatever level of

80
00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:33.080
Enlightenment that is possible

81
00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:36.360
And I also believe a belief system

82
00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.640
is something that is extremely unique

83
00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:39.820
to every single one of us

84
00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:41.940
there is no single belief system that

85
00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:43.260
is exactly the same and

86
00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.560
Religion was just a tool a means

87
00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.260
by which we use to describe

88
00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:49.520
something so that we can try and

89
00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:51.540
make some sense of it because this

90
00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:52.960
ethereal states this

91
00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:56.100
Theta this idea of what is life

92
00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:57.720
that isn't the measurable physical

93
00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:59.700
things we can put our hands on

94
00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:00.340
and measure here

95
00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:02.240
There's more to it that we don't

96
00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:04.740
understand and we're just trying to

97
00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:06.280
use the tools available available

98
00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:07.540
to us to describe it

99
00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:12.440
And so this is this is that

100
00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:14.460
this is the representation of

101
00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:16.960
The possibilities that are that are

102
00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:19.120
contained within a soul. We all start

103
00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:20.880
in the shadows. We all try to

104
00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:21.680
ascend to the light

105
00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:23.560
We all try to find our level

106
00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:25.780
of enlightenment and I encourage that

107
00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:27.480
of the third eye and the crown

108
00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:30.740
Because I value intelligence. I value

109
00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:33.360
minds that think beyond just the social

110
00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:34.900
programmings that we experience in

111
00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:35.460
a day-to-day

112
00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:41.100
I am erudite, but I am also

113
00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:43.680
candor. I also try to be abnegant

114
00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:46.100
and I'd like to think I'm dauntless

115
00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:49.020
But most of all I try to

116
00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:51.820
keep amnity in my heart as well. I

117
00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:53.820
draw from so many elements and

118
00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:57.700
This just existed long before that

119
00:03:57.700 --> 00:03:59.880
so I just wanted to share that

120
00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:01.600
with you so that you knew

121
00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:05.460
Who's this Markizano guy? Why is he

122
00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:06.380
here? And what is he doing all

123
00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:06.900
this stuff for?

124
00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:09.180
It's a projection of the self

125
00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:11.580
You have value too.
