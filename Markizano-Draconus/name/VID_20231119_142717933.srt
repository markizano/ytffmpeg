1
00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:02.940
So, let's talk about the etymology

2
00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:05.180
behind my name, because I see a

3
00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:05.680
lot of people

4
00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:07.860
messing this up, and I'm like, it's

5
00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:09.280
not that difficult, is it? Two letters

6
00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:11.109
at a time, right? I don't know. We'll see.

7
00:00:11.121 --> 00:00:11.809
We'll find out.

8
00:00:12.512 --> 00:00:14.260
Yeah, that's my government name.

9
00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:18.160
It's boring. One syllable: Mark.

10
00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:19.200
I mean, sure, it makes it easy to

11
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:20.260
remember, but

12
00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:23.740
I'm always a little bit more. Now,

13
00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:26.280
an extension to that could be Markiz or

14
00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:27.900
Marcus. There's two different spellings.

15
00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:30.500
I didn't really like Marcus. I like

16
00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.540
Markiz because of the Z. It's kind

17
00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:33.860
of fun drawing it out, too. Get

18
00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:34.720
that little line

19
00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:35.960
down the middle. Sometimes it might

20
00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.220
be there, might not be there. I

21
00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:38.640
also didn't

22
00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.420
like Marcus because it was, likewise,

23
00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.280
too common. If it was, you know,

24
00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:42.680
tried to be

25
00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:45.920
used as a username, it wouldn't work.

26
00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:48.440
So, I tried Markiz because

27
00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:52.460
it's an uncommon spelling and possibly

28
00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:54.920
could be unique to me, right? So,

29
00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.340
I added

30
00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:57.380
the last part and made it Markizano.

31
00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:00.140
And, typically, how languages work, the

32
00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:02.020
accent typically falls on the second

33
00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:05.140
to last syllable. So, Markizano. You

34
00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:05.460
can also

35
00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:06.560
put an accent over the "A" as

36
00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:08.000
well to say there's an emphasis on

37
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.800
the Mark part

38
00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:11.200
because it is an extension of my

39
00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:15.940
first name. Draconus. I don't know

40
00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:16.460
where people

41
00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:17.780
are getting the "I" from. It's not

42
00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:22.300
Draconius. I'm sorry. I don't see it, where do you?

43
00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:25.360
Draconis is an extension of Draco,

44
00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:28.660
which represents dragon. That is my Chinese

45
00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:31.600
zodiac and I definitely align with

46
00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:34.120
this, with all the personality traits.

47
00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:36.120
I'm quick with the tongue, incredibly

48
00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:38.000
intelligent, incredibly powerful.

49
00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:38.640
I have,

50
00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:40.040
you know, this kind of complex in

51
00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.260
my head. But, I'm also compassionate

52
00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:43.380
and willing

53
00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.340
to learn and always try to adapt

54
00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:48.780
to new things and with psychic abilities. So,

55
00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.840
that's a quick little etymology or

56
00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:52.500
history of my name in two minutes.

57
00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:54.420
Markizano Draconus.
