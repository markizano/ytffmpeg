# Intro

Greetings and welcome to Kizano's massage. My name is Markizano, and I will be your massage
therapist for the day.

## The Table
I only use high quality sheets with a thread count over 500. So rest assured that you'll be comfortable
on the table. I also only ever use Free and Clear detergents to minimize the chances of an allergen
reaction to the dyes or fragrances used in some detergents.

My goto substance for massage is a personal blend of coconut and almond oil. This is a nice mix that
allows for an effective massage that will also leave you functional for the rest of your day.
That's not to say that you can't have any substance you want. If you wish to have Grapeseed oil, a
specific lotion or cream, let me know and we'll make accommodations for you.

For deep tissue massage, I sometimes will use shea butter for the additional grip it provides to 
give you that deep muscle relaxation.

For longer sessions, I also offer the "Fire and Ice" massage, which includes a mix of ice stones,
hot stones, and hot towels for a very powerful natural release of stress and energy balance.

## The Experience

As far as the experience is concerned, let's start off with you filling out some paperwork so I can
better get to know you and your needs during the massage session. We'll also have a short interview
to help better understand where your focus areas are going to be during the session. I might ask some
occupational questions to understand your day job, which will help me zero in and focus on those
pesky areas where you might be experiencing frequent pains or soreness from your day job.

We will agree on a plan as far as where to start and how you will be oriented and then,
move forward with the massage. If there are ever any changes, we'll be sure to agree on this verbally
before diverting to a different plan.

By default, I play light music without lyrics (if possible) from the likes of Michelle McLaughlin,
Philip Wesley, and Jennifer Thomas.

For those that find it helpful, I also use light hypnotic suggestions where I'll help guide you
to a happy and relaxing place in your mind. Relaxing the mind helps relax the body. This session
is for you and your comfort.

If, at any time, you wish to have any changes to light, temperature, pressure or volume, please feel
free to let me know, and we'll be sure to accommodate you!

## My Style

I have a very soothing and sensual style. I will initially palpate the body to confirm the focus
areas discussed during the interview. If there are any changes to the plan, such as you realize
low back needs more attention than shoulders, then we'll agree on this verbally and I'll be sure
to focus accordingly during the massage.

I start slow and learn your body by listening. In massage class, you learn to "see" with your hands.
I'll increase pressure gradually and intuitively until your body says that is enough and I will be
sure to verbally confirm that with you before proceeding with the massage.

I'll check on you three to four times during the massage to ensure your comfort. If you fall asleep,
I'll continue with the massage, but avoid disturbing you until it's time to re-orient yourself on the
table.

## Pricing
Pricing is as follows:
- $90 for 60 minutes
- $120 for 90 minutes
- $150 for 120 minutes

For those of you who knew me during class, congratulations! Your prices will remain at my prices set
as a student during business class when I was prospecting this endeavor before inflation kicked in.
This will remain in effect until my next price re-evaluation in January of 2023.
For those of you that sign up today,
I'll maintain your prices until your intake forms need renewal every 2 years. I re-evaluate and raise
my prices anually subject to market conditions to stay competitive.
