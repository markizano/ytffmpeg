1
00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:01.980
Loneliness.

2
00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:05.400
Many are scared of loneliness.

3
00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:06.900
I wonder, I ponder...

4
00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:09.020
Are they really scared of themselves?

5
00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:11.860
To be afraid of being alone is

6
00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:14.000
to be unsatisfied with one's own company.

7
00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:16.980
Why fear one's own shadow?

8
00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:20.720
Loneliness should not be feared, unless

9
00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:22.000
you are a fearful person.

10
00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:25.500
People fear loneliness, but do they

11
00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:26.320
fear themselves?

12
00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:30.060
Ask yourself: am I really that bad company?

13
00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:32.600
You may be surprised at your answer.

14
00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.160
You may find that you really didn't

15
00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.140
like your own company.

16
00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.100
If so, then why?

17
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.040
Why do you carry with you what

18
00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.000
you make as part of yourself that

19
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:43.560
you don't like?

20
00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.480
What can you change?

21
00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:47.260
What can't you change?

22
00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:50.240
What may be hidden from truth that

23
00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:52.500
could be changed, if only you put

24
00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:53.360
in the shadow work?

25
00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:55.360
Do you want change?

26
00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.400
It could be very difficult,

27
00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:00.280
but the results could be so rewarding.

28
00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:04.120
Loneliness doesn't mean being alone.

29
00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:06.480
You could be in a crowd of

30
00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:08.300
people and still feel it.

31
00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.820
I say lean into it, embrace it.

32
00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.320
Admit it entry into your heart so

33
00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:15.960
that you may transmute it into the

34
00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:16.780
brightest light

35
00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:18.680
such that no one around you feels

36
00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:19.880
lonely ever again.

37
00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.560
Including yourself, but most of all:

38
00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.840
for yourself...
