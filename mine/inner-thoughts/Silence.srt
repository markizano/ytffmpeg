1
00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:03.000
Cannot stand the silence,

2
00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:04.000
some might say,

3
00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:05.880
or are you just upset

4
00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:07.560
from not getting your way?

5
00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:10.600
Interjections abound, the talk will

6
00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:13.020
talk on, but have you ever really

7
00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:14.180
sat in silence?

8
00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:17.160
Silence can be your best friend...

9
00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:18.440
If you let it...

10
00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:21.520
always there; accompanying every pause

11
00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:22.480
and break,

12
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.560
always there when you need a moment to reflect,

13
00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:27.400
never wavering...

14
00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:30.240
when you sit still long enough for it to reach you,

15
00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:32.200
never abandoning you,

16
00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:34.560
even if you disturb it just a little,

17
00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.240
never leaving your side, even if you

18
00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:38.520
told it to leave.

19
00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:40.800
Silence will never abandon you.

20
00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:43.720
Silence can be your best friend,

21
00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:44.680
if you let it.

22
00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:46.920
Ever present, ever loving,

23
00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:50.200
Silence never stops giving what it does best.

24
00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.760
Standing right there by your side,

25
00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:54.880
never leaving, never abandoning,

26
00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:57.900
Silence never judges you, you do,

27
00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.080
Silence never interrupts you.

28
00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.640
Silence never hurts you, you do.

29
00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:07.920
Silence will sit and listen patiently

30
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.160
to all your diatribes and monologues.

31
00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.280
Silence will let you judge yourself.

32
00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:17.520
Silence will listen as you continue to evolve and grow.

35
00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:19.840
Silence will not abandon you.

36
00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.360
As you discover the answer to your ponderings,

37
00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:24.800
Silence will be there.

38
00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:27.240
As you develop your mind,

39
00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:29.000
silence will be watching.

40
00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:31.840
As you rewrite your musings,

41
00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.880
silence will be listening.

42
00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.480
As you reach a new stage of consciousness,

43
00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.680
silence will be there.

44
00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:42.320
Silence is not to be feared

45
00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:43.800
or avoided.

46
00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.560
Silence should be embraced.

47
00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.800
Silence can give you yourself...

48
00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:53.240
but only if you are patient enough.

49
00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:56.400
If you are patient enough to list to yourself,

50
00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:58.060
to evolve and grow, silence

51
00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:01.360
can give you that, but only if

52
00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:02.040
you are patient

53
00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.640
enough to get to know yourself.

54
00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:07.080
Can you stand the silence?
