__Loneliness__

Many are scared of loneliness.
I wonder, I ponder.
Are they really scared of themselves?
To be afraid of being alone is to be unsatisfied with one's own company.

Why fear one's own shadow?
Loneliness should not be feared, unless you are a fearful person.

People fear loneliness, but do they fear themselves?
Ask yourself, am I really that bad company?

You may be surprised at your answer.
You may find that you really didn't like your own company.

If so, then why?

Why do you carry with you what you make as part of yourself that you don't like?

What can you change?
What can't you change?
What may be hidden from truth that could be changed, if only you put in the shadow work?
Do you want change?
It could be very difficult, but the results could be so rewarding.

Loneliness doesn't mean being alone.
You could be in a crowd of people and still feel it.

I say lean into it.
Embrace it.

Admit it entry into your heart so that you may transmute it
into the brightest light such that no one around you
feels lonely ever again...
Including yourself, but most of all: for yourself.
