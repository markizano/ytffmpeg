0:00:00.000 --> 0:00:01.320
Greetings and welcome to Kisela's

2
0:00:01.320 --> 0:00:02.460
Fintech channel where I take you

3
0:00:02.460 --> 0:00:03.940
from zero to master and IT

4
0:00:03.940 --> 0:00:04.440
and DevOps.

5
0:00:04.700 --> 0:00:05.680
In today's video we're going to

6
0:00:05.680 --> 0:00:07.200
be talking about some audio options

7
0:00:07.200 --> 0:00:08.280
that I have been trying to

8
0:00:08.280 --> 0:00:08.700
put together.

9
0:00:09.120 --> 0:00:10.820
This is kind of sort of

10
0:00:10.820 --> 0:00:12.580
an informal thing. I just have

11
0:00:12.580 --> 0:00:14.640
a few audio options here available

12
0:00:14.640 --> 0:00:15.200
to me

13
0:00:15.200 --> 0:00:17.000
and I wanted to present those

14
0:00:17.000 --> 0:00:18.200
to you here so that you

15
0:00:18.200 --> 0:00:19.800
can have a better idea of

16
0:00:19.800 --> 0:00:21.160
what some things may sound like

17
0:00:21.160 --> 0:00:22.700
depending on what tools I have

18
0:00:22.700 --> 0:00:23.360
available to me.

19
0:00:23.860 --> 0:00:26.420
We have some AirPods here which

20
0:00:26.420 --> 0:00:27.420
is kind of gloss over the

21
0:00:27.420 --> 0:00:28.980
fact that on Linux there's additional

22
0:00:28.980 --> 0:00:30.620
software and settings and configuration

23
0:00:30.620 --> 0:00:31.560
that need to be made.

24
0:00:31.860 --> 0:00:33.480
Just make these things available so

25
0:00:33.480 --> 0:00:34.820
thank you Apple. I appreciate the

26
0:00:34.820 --> 0:00:35.300
extra work.

27
0:00:35.620 --> 0:00:36.580
It'd be great to just connect

28
0:00:36.580 --> 0:00:37.740
to them Bluetooth and just plug

29
0:00:37.740 --> 0:00:40.460
and play but you know, got

30
0:00:40.460 --> 0:00:40.960
to do what you got to

31
0:00:40.960 --> 0:00:41.660
do when it comes to Linux.

32
0:00:42.300 --> 0:00:45.060
I also have these lavalier microphones.

33
0:00:45.680 --> 0:00:47.500
I found these on Amazon. Go

34
0:00:47.500 --> 0:00:48.300
ahead and pull up the product

35
0:00:48.300 --> 0:00:49.240
detail page here.

36
0:00:50.280 --> 0:00:52.300
I just found something that was

37
0:00:52.300 --> 0:00:54.420
within a decent price range that

38
0:00:54.420 --> 0:00:56.240
I could use and would allow

39
0:00:56.240 --> 0:00:57.040
me to be able to get

40
0:00:57.040 --> 0:00:58.680
wireless audio.

41
0:00:58.920 --> 0:01:00.160
So sometimes I have my phone

42
0:01:00.160 --> 0:01:01.280
set up here in the middle

43
0:01:01.280 --> 0:01:02.620
of the room and it's just

44
0:01:02.620 --> 0:01:04.040
not feasible for me to have

45
0:01:04.040 --> 0:01:06.800
a wired headset streaming from the

46
0:01:06.800 --> 0:01:07.020
phone.

47
0:01:07.960 --> 0:01:10.660
I'm afraid my voice isn't well

48
0:01:10.660 --> 0:01:12.180
enough to travel across the room

49
0:01:12.180 --> 0:01:13.680
and catch with all the acoustics.

50
0:01:14.740 --> 0:01:18.240
So having this connected also mumps

51
0:01:18.240 --> 0:01:19.680
with my necklace somewhere.

52
0:01:20.500 --> 0:01:21.540
And so sometimes you see me

53
0:01:21.540 --> 0:01:25.080
go without it because it's incredibly

54
0:01:25.080 --> 0:01:26.780
painful hearing that in the audio.

55
0:01:27.260 --> 0:01:29.140
Trust me, I hear you. I'm

56
0:01:29.140 --> 0:01:29.520
with you.

57
0:01:29.760 --> 0:01:31.840
And well, when you're going with

58
0:01:31.840 --> 0:01:33.700
what you've got and trying not

59
0:01:33.700 --> 0:01:35.120
to dump thousands of dollars in

60
0:01:35.120 --> 0:01:35.720
new hardware,

61
0:01:36.900 --> 0:01:38.280
well, this is what I've had

62
0:01:38.280 --> 0:01:39.660
available to me up until now

63
0:01:39.660 --> 0:01:41.440
and I just want to kind

64
0:01:41.440 --> 0:01:42.340
of sort of put this together

65
0:01:42.340 --> 0:01:43.800
so that you could see in

66
0:01:43.800 --> 0:01:44.440
real time

67
0:01:44.440 --> 0:01:46.560
a screenshot of kind of sort

68
0:01:46.560 --> 0:01:47.940
of what's going on here and

69
0:01:47.940 --> 0:01:49.860
what's happening and see what's going

70
0:01:49.860 --> 0:01:50.200
on here.

71
0:01:50.640 --> 0:01:52.820
So I also have a webcam.

72
0:01:53.160 --> 0:01:54.680
That's what you're watching me on

73
0:01:54.680 --> 0:01:56.280
right now that is USB connected

74
0:01:56.280 --> 0:01:57.180
into my laptop.

75
0:01:57.180 --> 0:01:58.460
And I have to raise my

76
0:01:58.460 --> 0:01:59.560
voice just a little bit just

77
0:01:59.560 --> 0:02:01.080
to make sure that the webcam

78
0:02:01.080 --> 0:02:02.740
is capable of hearing me.

79
0:02:02.960 --> 0:02:04.780
Here on the screen share here,

80
0:02:04.900 --> 0:02:06.300
I've got a Pabu control setup

81
0:02:06.300 --> 0:02:07.920
so that you can see what

82
0:02:07.920 --> 0:02:09.620
options there are available to me

83
0:02:09.620 --> 0:02:10.960
as far as input devices are

84
0:02:10.960 --> 0:02:11.360
concerned.

85
0:02:12.060 --> 0:02:14.360
And I can also select what

86
0:02:14.360 --> 0:02:16.300
kind of configuration I want. You'll

87
0:02:16.300 --> 0:02:17.860
see that as I select those

88
0:02:17.860 --> 0:02:18.320
over here.

89
0:02:18.880 --> 0:02:20.040
In this other window, I've got

90
0:02:20.040 --> 0:02:21.920
my Bluetooth connection here and I

91
0:02:21.920 --> 0:02:22.940
guess I can go ahead and

92
0:02:22.940 --> 0:02:24.340
start off with the AirPods.

93
0:02:24.660 --> 0:02:26.840
We can connect those in very

94
0:02:26.840 --> 0:02:27.100
quick.

95
0:02:28.640 --> 0:02:33.020
And once those are connected, what

96
0:02:33.020 --> 0:02:33.840
I can do is I can

97
0:02:33.840 --> 0:02:36.780
shift the recording to actually watch

98
0:02:36.780 --> 0:02:37.640
for the AirPods.

99
0:02:37.880 --> 0:02:39.020
I need to configure them first.

100
0:02:39.800 --> 0:02:41.780
Yeah, in AirPods, they actually have

101
0:02:41.780 --> 0:02:43.300
two settings. You may not know

102
0:02:43.300 --> 0:02:45.060
this, but there's the hands-free

103
0:02:45.060 --> 0:02:47.460
headset and there's also just the

104
0:02:47.460 --> 0:02:47.760
playback.

105
0:02:48.020 --> 0:02:51.020
They do produce unique outputs and

106
0:02:51.020 --> 0:02:53.420
I was going to demonstrate switching

107
0:02:53.420 --> 0:02:54.420
over to the AirPods, but it

108
0:02:54.420 --> 0:02:57.280
seems you've already been switched

109
0:02:57.280 --> 0:02:57.600
over.

110
0:02:57.900 --> 0:02:58.960
So that's just wonderful.

111
0:03:02.160 --> 0:03:03.720
I could switch the audio back

112
0:03:03.720 --> 0:03:05.340
to the webcam and now you

113
0:03:05.340 --> 0:03:07.040
can hear back-to-back with

114
0:03:07.040 --> 0:03:08.700
a little bit more intention of

115
0:03:08.700 --> 0:03:09.500
what it looks like when I

116
0:03:09.500 --> 0:03:11.400
switch to the AirPods.

117
0:03:12.040 --> 0:03:15.580
And that audio can play out

118
0:03:15.580 --> 0:03:16.180
for you right there.

119
0:03:16.560 --> 0:03:19.240
I did experiment with the Kodak.

120
0:03:19.660 --> 0:03:21.560
It looks like it doesn't have

121
0:03:21.560 --> 0:03:24.300
any visible audio effect that I

122
0:03:24.300 --> 0:03:24.940
could detect.

123
0:03:25.420 --> 0:03:26.980
I'm guessing it's just a matter

124
0:03:26.980 --> 0:03:28.800
of how this information gets transmitted

125
0:03:28.800 --> 0:03:29.360
over Bluetooth.

126
0:03:30.020 --> 0:03:31.220
I read something about that as

127
0:03:31.220 --> 0:03:32.680
I was trying to understand how

128
0:03:32.680 --> 0:03:35.900
audio works when it comes to

129
0:03:35.900 --> 0:03:38.680
especially the Bluetooth devices because

130
0:03:38.680 --> 0:03:39.400
I was trying to find the

131
0:03:39.400 --> 0:03:40.280
best audio options.

132
0:03:41.280 --> 0:03:42.680
But seeing as that is, I

133
0:03:42.680 --> 0:03:43.580
can go ahead and switch over

134
0:03:43.580 --> 0:03:45.160
to the next one, which is

135
0:03:45.160 --> 0:03:46.460
this lot of their microphone here.

136
0:03:46.840 --> 0:03:48.360
If I press the button and

137
0:03:48.360 --> 0:03:49.860
that activates it, turns it on.

138
0:03:50.060 --> 0:03:51.260
It's got a USB charger on

139
0:03:51.260 --> 0:03:52.160
the side so that I can

140
0:03:52.160 --> 0:03:53.080
keep it charged up.

141
0:03:53.640 --> 0:03:54.580
I can use it as an

142
0:03:54.580 --> 0:03:55.820
input device here. I'm going to

143
0:03:55.820 --> 0:03:56.700
go ahead and also switch it

144
0:03:56.700 --> 0:03:57.760
back to the webcam.

145
0:04:06.500 --> 0:04:07.560
We're going to go ahead and

146
0:04:07.560 --> 0:04:12.760
connect the microphone in. It's got

147
0:04:12.760 --> 0:04:14.180
two pieces that connect here.

148
0:04:15.720 --> 0:04:17.600
Press your button, they turn on,

149
0:04:17.860 --> 0:04:19.280
they pair automatically. There's no

150
0:04:19.280 --> 0:04:20.980
need for me to make any

151
0:04:20.980 --> 0:04:22.540
connections there, which is great.

152
0:04:23.300 --> 0:04:27.420
It's just connecting go. The input

153
0:04:27.420 --> 0:04:29.040
is 3.5mm, so that means

154
0:04:29.040 --> 0:04:30.400
there's no additional drivers that

155
0:04:30.400 --> 0:04:30.820
are required.

156
0:04:32.140 --> 0:04:33.380
If I switch the audio over

157
0:04:33.380 --> 0:04:38.180
to this and say analog stereo,

158
0:04:42.420 --> 0:04:47.640
and now you should be hearing

159
0:04:47.640 --> 0:04:48.920
me out of the microphone.

160
0:04:49.780 --> 0:04:52.140
With this, the distance really does

161
0:04:52.140 --> 0:04:53.960
make a difference as far as

162
0:04:53.960 --> 0:04:55.380
how this audio sounds.

163
0:04:56.020 --> 0:04:57.800
I've also tried experimenting with

164
0:04:57.800 --> 0:04:59.560
the volume marker just to see

165
0:04:59.560 --> 0:05:01.500
what sounded good, what sounded bad.

166
0:05:02.140 --> 0:05:03.580
Sometimes I could turn it up

167
0:05:03.580 --> 0:05:05.060
and it would sound really, really

168
0:05:05.060 --> 0:05:05.580
distorted.

169
0:05:06.540 --> 0:05:08.320
I'd leave it in a mid

170
0:05:08.320 --> 0:05:10.840
-45 range and then give myself

171
0:05:10.840 --> 0:05:12.460
enough speaking distance so that my

172
0:05:12.460 --> 0:05:13.620
voice had a chance to travel,

173
0:05:13.880 --> 0:05:15.700
and dissipate a little bit because

174
0:05:15.700 --> 0:05:17.020
if it's right up next to

175
0:05:17.020 --> 0:05:18.900
me, it sounds really distorted. It's

176
0:05:18.900 --> 0:05:19.460
just not pleasant.

177
0:05:20.300 --> 0:05:23.340
Next, we've got the wired headset.

178
0:05:23.660 --> 0:05:26.620
3.5mm, totally plain, simple.

179
0:05:27.740 --> 0:05:28.740
I use it for listening to

180
0:05:28.740 --> 0:05:31.920
music and having phone calls, and

181
0:05:31.920 --> 0:05:33.100
they have served me well.

182
0:05:34.280 --> 0:05:35.380
I feel like I get the

183
0:05:35.380 --> 0:05:37.760
best audio from this, so we

184
0:05:37.760 --> 0:05:38.560
can plug this one in.

185
0:05:39.640 --> 0:05:41.400
Now, you should be hearing me

186
0:05:41.400 --> 0:05:43.960
out of the headset stereo.

187
0:05:44.540 --> 0:05:45.620
I apologize if there was some

188
0:05:45.620 --> 0:05:46.380
audio in there before.

189
0:05:47.300 --> 0:05:49.980
There is an internal microphone. I

190
0:05:49.980 --> 0:05:51.300
can show you that here right

191
0:05:51.300 --> 0:05:51.580
now.

192
0:05:51.980 --> 0:05:53.820
Speaker warning, you're going to want

193
0:05:53.820 --> 0:05:54.960
to turn the speakers down for

194
0:05:54.960 --> 0:05:55.640
just a moment.

195
0:05:56.440 --> 0:06:00.100
And now you can hear all

196
0:06:00.100 --> 0:06:03.120
the wonderful fan noise of what's

197
0:06:03.120 --> 0:06:03.980
going on in the computer.

198
0:06:04.280 --> 0:06:05.660
That is the built-in microphone

199
0:06:05.660 --> 0:06:07.180
to the computer. I usually leave

200
0:06:07.180 --> 0:06:08.500
that muted so that you can't

201
0:06:08.500 --> 0:06:08.860
hear it.

202
0:06:11.160 --> 0:06:14.500
Now, if I change this back

203
0:06:14.500 --> 0:06:15.760
to the headset, you should be

204
0:06:15.760 --> 0:06:17.000
hearing me out of this thing.

205
0:06:17.240 --> 0:06:19.200
And it shouldn't sound that bad,

206
0:06:19.320 --> 0:06:23.540
except when it makes those connections

207
0:06:23.540 --> 0:06:24.680
with my necklace.

208
0:06:25.260 --> 0:06:26.800
That is also not pleasant. It's

209
0:06:26.800 --> 0:06:27.520
kind of one of the reasons

210
0:06:27.520 --> 0:06:28.940
why I either don't wear this

211
0:06:28.940 --> 0:06:32.100
when I'm using this, or pretty

212
0:06:32.100 --> 0:06:32.480
much that.

213
0:06:33.360 --> 0:06:34.820
I'm also going to splice in

214
0:06:34.820 --> 0:06:36.720
some audio from my phone, because

215
0:06:36.720 --> 0:06:38.320
I think it's important to understand

216
0:06:38.320 --> 0:06:40.960
all the devices that I have

217
0:06:40.960 --> 0:06:41.940
to my avail,

218
0:06:42.520 --> 0:06:43.720
and what those sound like as

219
0:06:43.720 --> 0:06:45.100
well, because I wanted to put

220
0:06:45.100 --> 0:06:46.140
all of this stuff in there

221
0:06:46.140 --> 0:06:47.000
back to back to back.

222
0:06:47.640 --> 0:06:50.400
Now, there are two apps in

223
0:06:50.400 --> 0:06:51.500
my phone that I'm actually going

224
0:06:51.500 --> 0:06:53.060
to demonstrate in the recordings that

225
0:06:53.060 --> 0:06:54.300
I'm going to splice into the

226
0:06:54.300 --> 0:06:54.880
video here.

227
0:06:55.740 --> 0:06:57.120
One of them is the built

228
0:06:57.120 --> 0:06:58.460
-in application that came with the

229
0:06:58.460 --> 0:07:00.100
phone, and the other is called

230
0:07:00.100 --> 0:07:00.740
X Camera.

231
0:07:00.740 --> 0:07:01.840
I found this on the App

232
0:07:01.840 --> 0:07:03.660
Store, and they've actually been responsive

233
0:07:03.660 --> 0:07:06.140
with me with regards to actually

234
0:07:06.140 --> 0:07:07.720
providing improvements to the application,

235
0:07:07.980 --> 0:07:09.820
because what really dazzled me was

236
0:07:09.820 --> 0:07:11.340
this application actually pulled the

237
0:07:11.340 --> 0:07:13.440
horsepower out of this 108 megapixel

238
0:07:13.440 --> 0:07:15.360
camera that I have been dying

239
0:07:15.360 --> 0:07:17.800
to take advantage of.

240
0:07:17.900 --> 0:07:19.300
I felt like the default application

241
0:07:19.300 --> 0:07:20.520
just did not do the camera

242
0:07:20.520 --> 0:07:20.900
justice.

243
0:07:21.980 --> 0:07:25.120
So, this is a recording of

244
0:07:25.120 --> 0:07:26.100
what it looks like with me

245
0:07:26.100 --> 0:07:27.860
speaking directly to the phone with

246
0:07:27.860 --> 0:07:28.920
no added microphones.

247
0:07:29.840 --> 0:07:31.140
As you can see, the sound

248
0:07:31.140 --> 0:07:33.420
is fairly decent, and it also

249
0:07:33.420 --> 0:07:34.920
depends on how far away from

250
0:07:34.920 --> 0:07:37.100
my face the phone is as

251
0:07:37.100 --> 0:07:38.260
far as the audio is concerned.

252
0:07:38.960 --> 0:07:39.820
Now, in order for me to

253
0:07:39.820 --> 0:07:41.000
change the stream, I do have

254
0:07:41.000 --> 0:07:42.060
to stop the recording here on

255
0:07:42.060 --> 0:07:43.280
the phone, in order for me

256
0:07:43.280 --> 0:07:44.020
to be able to use any

257
0:07:44.020 --> 0:07:45.020
of the 3.5 million years.

258
0:07:46.860 --> 0:07:52.260
And so, now this is what

259
0:07:52.260 --> 0:07:53.540
it sounds like with the wired

260
0:07:53.540 --> 0:07:55.180
headset connected to my device as

261
0:07:55.180 --> 0:07:55.420
well.

262
0:07:56.300 --> 0:07:57.900
As you can see, I feel

263
0:07:57.900 --> 0:07:59.120
like this is where the best

264
0:07:59.120 --> 0:08:01.100
audio is going to be captured

265
0:08:01.100 --> 0:08:02.300
as far as what I can

266
0:08:02.300 --> 0:08:03.780
use within this device itself.

267
0:08:04.580 --> 0:08:05.820
I can pause the video in

268
0:08:05.820 --> 0:08:06.760
this clip here, and I can

269
0:08:06.760 --> 0:08:07.580
show you what it sounds like

270
0:08:07.580 --> 0:08:08.920
when I use the lavalier microphone.

271
0:08:11.660 --> 0:08:19.620
So, this is what it sounds

272
0:08:19.620 --> 0:08:21.100
like with the lavalier microphone.

273
0:08:21.240 --> 0:08:23.160
This is with the added 3

274
0:08:23.160 --> 0:08:24.620
.5 millimeter. I switched over to

275
0:08:24.620 --> 0:08:24.900
this.

276
0:08:25.120 --> 0:08:27.200
So, now you can hear the

277
0:08:27.200 --> 0:08:30.340
bass and how the distance has

278
0:08:30.340 --> 0:08:32.440
an effect on how the audio

279
0:08:32.440 --> 0:08:32.840
sounds.

280
0:08:32.980 --> 0:08:34.780
I don't have any microphone controls

281
0:08:34.780 --> 0:08:37.140
within the phone itself, so whatever

282
0:08:37.140 --> 0:08:38.460
it gives me is whatever it

283
0:08:38.460 --> 0:08:38.860
gives me.

284
0:08:39.080 --> 0:08:40.860
That's all you get. Android is

285
0:08:40.860 --> 0:08:43.720
really bad at managing audio. I'm

286
0:08:43.720 --> 0:08:44.600
pretty sure it just cut out

287
0:08:44.600 --> 0:08:44.820
too.

288
0:08:45.400 --> 0:08:46.360
So, we can add that to

289
0:08:46.360 --> 0:08:47.360
the review as well for this

290
0:08:47.360 --> 0:08:47.580
thing.
