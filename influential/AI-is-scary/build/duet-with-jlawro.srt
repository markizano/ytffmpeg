1
0:00:05.920 --> 0:00:07.280
And this is not so far

2
0:00:07.280 --> 0:00:08.840
off from the reality that we

3
0:00:08.840 --> 0:00:10.460
create amongst ourselves whenever

4
0:00:10.460 --> 0:00:11.900
we venture off into a video

5
0:00:11.900 --> 0:00:13.520
game or decide we want to

6
0:00:13.520 --> 0:00:15.760
abuse some substance to aberrate

7
0:00:15.760 --> 0:00:17.140
ourselves from this thing that we

8
0:00:17.140 --> 0:00:18.540
call our reality.

9
0:00:39.960 --> 0:00:42.000
And given the considerable amount

10
0:00:42.000 --> 0:00:43.820
of difficulty people experience these

11
0:00:43.820 --> 0:00:45.040
days with making connections

12
0:00:45.040 --> 0:00:47.140
with other human beings, why wouldn't

13
0:00:47.140 --> 0:00:47.980
this become a thing?

14
0:00:53.243 --> 0:00:54.460
And I agree with this, I

15
0:00:54.460 --> 0:00:56.240
think most people would prefer another

16
0:00:56.240 --> 0:00:58.780
human, but when you consider

17
0:00:58.780 --> 0:01:00.340
the options that we have available

18
0:01:00.340 --> 0:01:01.320
to us, some of us might

19
0:01:01.320 --> 0:01:02.760
look around thinking, hmm,

20
0:01:03.840 --> 0:01:05.180
that AI ain't looking too bad.

21
0:01:20.874 --> 0:01:23.020
But I think you're also glossing

22
0:01:23.020 --> 0:01:25.380
over this idea of child permanence

23
0:01:25.380 --> 0:01:25.620
here.

24
0:01:25.820 --> 0:01:27.780
Just because a state of being

25
0:01:27.780 --> 0:01:29.720
is within this moment doesn't necessarily

26
0:01:29.720 --> 0:01:30.480
mean that state

27
0:01:30.480 --> 0:01:32.020
of being will always be there.

28
0:01:32.380 --> 0:01:34.280
So even if AI does become

29
0:01:34.280 --> 0:01:36.140
better at relationships than humans

30
0:01:36.140 --> 0:01:38.540
do, do you really think it's

31
0:01:38.540 --> 0:01:38.960
reasonable

32
0:01:38.960 --> 0:01:40.420
to assume that everything is in

33
0:01:40.420 --> 0:01:42.660
absolutes and that all humans will

34
0:01:42.660 --> 0:01:44.040
prefer AI relationships?

35
0:01:44.320 --> 0:01:44.520
No.

36
0:01:45.460 --> 0:01:47.620
When has anything ever been absolute

37
0:01:47.620 --> 0:01:48.480
in this world?

38
0:01:48.500 --> 0:01:51.440
When has anybody ever chosen the

39
0:01:51.440 --> 0:01:54.140
same exact thing, no matter what,

40
0:01:54.400 --> 0:01:56.100
time after time, and

41
0:01:56.100 --> 0:01:57.540
that is the thing.

42
0:01:57.920 --> 0:01:59.460
We're describing these things as if

43
0:01:59.460 --> 0:02:00.700
that's going to be the way,

44
0:02:01.080 --> 0:02:03.460
when in reality, it's

45
0:02:03.460 --> 0:02:04.340
just one way.

46
0:02:34.400 --> 0:02:36.740
I beg to

47
0:02:36.740 --> 0:02:37.960
differ with this point.

48
0:02:38.560 --> 0:02:40.420
You see, in my relationships with

49
0:02:40.420 --> 0:02:42.640
some folks, I have been coming

50
0:02:42.640 --> 0:02:43.800
to the conclusion that

51
0:02:43.800 --> 0:02:46.460
some people want that level of

52
0:02:46.460 --> 0:02:50.540
understanding, all-knowing, and belief

53
0:02:50.540 --> 0:02:51.660
that something will

54
0:02:51.660 --> 0:02:53.040
always be there for you to

55
0:02:53.040 --> 0:02:54.260
give you that sake of comfort.

56
0:02:54.520 --> 0:02:56.500
Not so that you don't have

57
0:02:56.500 --> 0:02:58.100
to change, but to give you

58
0:02:58.100 --> 0:02:59.520
the comfort and the stability

59
0:02:59.520 --> 0:03:00.920
that you need to stand upon

60
0:03:00.920 --> 0:03:02.140
so that you can make the

61
0:03:02.140 --> 0:03:03.780
greatest change of your life.

62
0:03:04.160 --> 0:03:06.300
Case in point, here in my

63
0:03:06.300 --> 0:03:08.260
life, in my time, I've been

64
0:03:08.260 --> 0:03:11.120
trying to build a family, a

65
0:03:11.120 --> 0:03:11.400
collection

66
0:03:11.400 --> 0:03:13.120
of people who I know won't

67
0:03:13.120 --> 0:03:14.220
bail on me at the first

68
0:03:14.220 --> 0:03:14.920
sign of trouble.

69
0:03:15.340 --> 0:03:16.840
People that I know who will

70
0:03:16.840 --> 0:03:18.420
be there for me whenever there

71
0:03:18.420 --> 0:03:19.320
are times of need.

72
0:03:19.800 --> 0:03:21.540
Some people say those are just

73
0:03:21.540 --> 0:03:21.960
friends.

74
0:03:22.360 --> 0:03:23.860
My opinion of it is, no,

75
0:03:23.880 --> 0:03:24.840
those are true friends.

76
0:03:25.260 --> 0:03:27.100
A lot of people encounter superficial

77
0:03:27.100 --> 0:03:29.500
people that don't exactly dip beyond

78
0:03:29.500 --> 0:03:30.140
the surface.

79
0:03:31.160 --> 0:03:32.380
But once I have that level

80
0:03:32.380 --> 0:03:34.220
of stability and that unconditional

81
0:03:34.220 --> 0:03:38.020
love, then I feel as if

82
0:03:38.020 --> 0:03:39.100
I am able to flourish.

83
0:04:22.580 --> 0:04:24.280
I think another aspect of

84
0:04:24.280 --> 0:04:25.460
this that we seem to be

85
0:04:25.460 --> 0:04:27.160
glossing over is the fact that

86
0:04:27.160 --> 0:04:28.860
this could just be another tool

87
0:04:28.860 --> 0:04:30.700
in order to help us obtain

88
0:04:30.700 --> 0:04:31.900
that better knowledge when it

89
0:04:31.900 --> 0:04:33.380
comes to emotional intelligence.

90
0:04:33.980 --> 0:04:35.580
For example, like you said with

91
0:04:35.580 --> 0:04:37.180
the example of being able to

92
0:04:37.180 --> 0:04:39.460
understand vast swaths of

93
0:04:39.460 --> 0:04:39.760
people.

94
0:04:40.120 --> 0:04:41.260
That is to say that we

95
0:04:41.260 --> 0:04:42.620
couldn't take that information and

96
0:04:42.620 --> 0:04:43.980
use it as a learning mechanism

97
0:04:43.980 --> 0:04:46.140
such that other people would be

98
0:04:46.140 --> 0:04:47.880
able to learn from those experiences

99
0:04:47.880 --> 0:04:49.120
rather than using them

100
0:04:49.120 --> 0:04:50.540
as a replacement or a fill-in

101
0:04:50.540 --> 0:04:53.060
to the actual relationship that

102
0:04:53.060 --> 0:04:53.660
would ensue.

103
0:05:02.685 --> 0:05:04.440
but does it have to be

104
0:05:04.440 --> 0:05:04.860
real?

105
0:05:04.860 --> 0:05:07.160
In order to have the experience

106
0:05:07.160 --> 0:05:10.000
from the person who is experiencing,

107
0:05:10.800 --> 0:05:11.600
does it really matter?

108
0:05:16.492 --> 0:05:17.492
Yes.

109
0:05:28.114 --> 0:05:30.540
And it's also something that can

110
0:05:30.540 --> 0:05:31.700
be used as a tool.

111
0:06:28.761 --> 0:06:30.040
True.

112
0:06:30.040 --> 0:06:32.540
and that is something that some

113
0:06:32.540 --> 0:06:33.980
kind of greater intelligence with

114
0:06:33.980 --> 0:06:35.100
that unconditional love

115
0:06:35.100 --> 0:06:37.560
could provide for us. So that

116
0:06:37.560 --> 0:06:39.480
we could better understand our pain

117
0:06:39.480 --> 0:06:41.800
and better also appreciate

118
0:06:41.800 --> 0:06:43.520
the joy that comes from it

119
0:06:43.520 --> 0:06:44.160
as well.

120
0:06:48.854 --> 0:06:49.972
A disappointment.

121
0:07:30.060 --> 0:07:32.160
It doesn't seem like something that

122
0:07:32.160 --> 0:07:33.460
we as humans would do.

123
0:07:34.420 --> 0:07:37.200
We crave that pain far too

124
0:07:37.200 --> 0:07:39.020
much and far too many of

125
0:07:39.020 --> 0:07:41.480
us are so fixated on creating

126
0:07:41.480 --> 0:07:42.120
problems

127
0:07:42.120 --> 0:07:43.760
so that we can work on

128
0:07:43.760 --> 0:07:45.780
the solutions in order for us

129
0:07:45.780 --> 0:07:49.580
to completely forgo any chance at

130
0:07:49.580 --> 0:07:49.960
a future.

131
0:08:24.486 --> 0:08:26.760
Because we crave that evolution and

132
0:08:26.760 --> 0:08:27.220
growth.

133
0:08:27.940 --> 0:08:30.220
We as humans are just the

134
0:08:30.220 --> 0:08:32.320
experience of a spiritual element,

135
0:08:32.420 --> 0:08:35.120
a soul that craves that

136
0:08:35.120 --> 0:08:38.760
understanding, that growth, that hidden

137
0:08:38.760 --> 0:08:41.740
meaning beyond what it is we

137
0:08:41.740 --> 0:08:43.820
feel in these flesh bodies

138
0:08:43.820 --> 0:08:44.460
these days.

139
0:08:57.220 --> 0:08:59.520
And how is that any different

140
0:08:59.520 --> 0:09:02.360
from the drugs and the addicts

141
0:09:02.360 --> 0:09:03.400
that we have these days?

142
0:09:04.160 --> 0:09:05.620
Because the argument could be made

143
0:09:05.620 --> 0:09:07.040
the same from way back then.

144
0:09:07.500 --> 0:09:09.260
When those drugs and those things

145
0:09:09.260 --> 0:09:12.980
were new, well, didn't people think

146
0:09:12.980 --> 0:09:14.040
that everybody would

147
0:09:14.040 --> 0:09:15.140
be hyped up on drugs?

148
0:09:15.920 --> 0:09:17.180
Now, if we look at ourselves

149
0:09:17.180 --> 0:09:19.900
today, is everybody hyped up on

150
0:09:19.900 --> 0:09:20.440
those drugs?

151
0:09:20.700 --> 0:09:22.420
Or do we sometimes have people

152
0:09:22.420 --> 0:09:26.280
who oftentimes elect not to live

153
0:09:26.280 --> 0:09:27.880
in the state of constant bliss?

154
0:09:28.600 --> 0:09:31.100
Who elect to live here in

155
0:09:31.100 --> 0:09:32.100
this state of reality?

156
0:09:32.520 --> 0:09:34.160
Who decide they want to continue

157
0:09:34.160 --> 0:09:35.660
to pursue their life, their dreams,

158
0:09:35.780 --> 0:09:36.980
their goals, their hopes, their wishes?

159
0:09:52.180 --> 0:09:53.220
Well, that depends.

176
0:09:55.000 --> 0:09:57.000
How much of your agency are

177
0:09:57.000 --> 0:09:58.420
you willing to give up for

178
0:09:58.420 --> 0:09:59.120
the sake of freedom?
