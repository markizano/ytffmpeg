1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.080
let's talk about AI now this is

2
00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:04.700
coming from somebody who is getting

3
00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:05.840
into AI and

4
00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:08.440
I hear so much fear around me

5
00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:10.200
as people are like oh my god

6
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.360
AI is scary AI is

7
00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:12.580
scary well let me tell you what

8
00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:16.100
man fears what he doesn't know man

9
00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:16.400
fears

10
00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:19.480
what he doesn't understand so if you

11
00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:22.180
don't know AI and you fear AI

12
00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:22.760
you

13
00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:24.500
really should get to know AI I

14
00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:27.540
don't know why because you know how

15
00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:27.760
you're

16
00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:29.020
thumbing through this app and just

17
00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:31.200
flicking through these videos that's

18
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:31.400
AI

19
00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:33.000
you know when you go to Google

20
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.460
and you want to search for something

21
00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:34.760
and it

22
00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:36.400
pulls up those results or even tries

23
00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:38.020
to suggest to you those recommendations

24
00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:44.240
that's AI when anything tries to help

25
00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:45.960
you out by trying to come up

26
00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:46.220
with some

27
00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:47.660
kind of interpretation and provide

28
00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:49.140
you with some kind of recommendation

29
00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.460
advertisements suggestions the recommendation

30
00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:55.460
engine all of that is AI

31
00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:56.960
when you go to call up your

32
00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:01.600
assistant Siri Google Alexa be that

33
00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.140
in a device be

34
00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:08.460
it's in your phone that's AI so

35
00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.140
everybody says it's all scary and

36
00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:10.480
stuff

37
00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:12.660
but the reality is it's a tool

38
00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:16.240
and what's really scary is what people

39
00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:16.700
do

40
00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:19.840
with it is it a gun or

41
00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.160
is it a syringe or is it

42
00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:25.380
a scalpel is it a hammer it

43
00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.560
depends on what you do with that

44
00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:32.300
tool it depends on how you leverage

45
00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:33.600
it do

46
00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.800
you allow it to control you do

47
00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:37.120
you sit there and just mindlessly

48
00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:37.760
thumb through

49
00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:40.180
and allow the engine to program you

50
00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:43.480
or do you stay in control and

51
00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:44.000
you say no

52
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.440
I'm not going to allow you to

53
00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:48.420
show me that do you teach your

54
00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.340
AI do you stay in

55
00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.080
control because as long as you relinquish

56
00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:57.320
your agency somebody else is

57
00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:58.320
more than happy to come and take

58
00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.340
it for you somebody else is more

59
00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:01.460
than happy to

60
00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:03.180
drive your fingers and your hands

61
00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.920
for you so if you want to

62
00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:07.300
know how to

63
00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:09.780
survive in AI in this day and

64
00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.720
age maintain agency do not give this

65
00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:14.920
up this

66
00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:18.120
is one of your most precious tools

67
00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.760
this is one of your most precious

68
00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:22.780
possessions

69
00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:25.340
and you're gonna let somebody else

70
00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.640
control that it's no wonder why so

71
00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.760
many

72
00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:29.020
people say that we only use 20

73
00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:30.900
% of our brain it's not because

74
00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:31.500
we're not using

75
00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.040
all the muscles it's because you're

76
00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:36.280
not using the full capacity you shut

77
00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:36.440
your

78
00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.260
brain off at night because learning

79
00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.300
is hard because working this muscle

80
00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.760
hurts

81
00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:42.920
you may want to consider changing

82
00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:45.060
that you sit around all day long

83
00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:45.900
not doing

84
00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:47.620
anything as far as physical activity

85
00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:48.440
is concerned and 

86
00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.980
then wonder by your why

87
00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:52.500
your body is atrophying it's because

88
00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.920
you're not using those muscles if

89
00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:55.040
you

90
00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.440
don't use it you will lose it

91
00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:59.340
coming from somebody who's who almost

92
00:02:59.340 --> 00:02:59.760
lost his

93
00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.640
Spanish went ten years not speaking

94
00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:02.920
it but I don't know what happened

95
00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:03.240
with this

96
00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:05.340
I have a friend who can speak

97
00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:07.600
Spanish but I can speak it better

98
00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:09.840
but I can speak it a lot

99
00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:11.120
better now because I see him once

100
00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.660
a week and I get

101
00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:12.800
full immersion because he doesn't

102
00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:14.000
know English yet and that's fine...

103
00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.062
esta bien (it's okay).

104
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.564
Demo nihongo (but, Japanese),

105
00:03:17.564 --> 00:03:19.433
ore wa wakataimasu (I understand [a little])

106
00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:20.901
soshite (also),

107
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.070
sore wa watashi no genkai dewanai (this is not my limit).

108
00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.000
I also want to learn Mandarin,

109
00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.640
Arabic, Hebrew I'm gonna read and understand

110
00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:29.940
and know everything... why?

111
00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:36.140
Because AI is my rival. I finally found

112
00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:37.240
a worthy opponent 8)

113
00:03:40.087 --> 00:03:41.540
knowing the names of

114
00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:43.340
these entities: whisper, which will

115
00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:44.940
allow you to do voice-to-text

116
00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:46.220
`tesseract`, which

117
00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:47.840
will be able to take images convert

118
00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:50.120
those to text e-speak which will

119
00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:50.340
allow

120
00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:51.960
you to take text turn it into

121
00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:54.180
synthesized voice it's only a matter

122
00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:54.340
of

123
00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:55.740
time before I learn how to create

124
00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:57.580
an avatar of myself and I'm able

125
00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:58.180
to produce

126
00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:01.300
AI videos it's a cool fun little

127
00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:03.740
experiment now as far as what we

128
00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:04.000
do

129
00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.620
with it if the only image in

130
00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:07.360
your mind after hearing those things

131
00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:07.680
I just

132
00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.140
described to you is the Terminator

133
00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:12.140
you really really need to pick up

134
00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.660
more books

135
00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:15.260
you really really need to read and

136
00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:19.560
expand your mind because if the image

137
00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:21.400
of the Terminator is the only thing

138
00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:23.060
you see whenever you think of AI

139
00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:24.240
guess what

140
00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:26.260
you are going to attract to yourself

141
00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.920
because if there's one truth I have

142
00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:31.500
learned it is that the law of

143
00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:34.220
attraction is one of the most powerful

144
00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:37.760
forces on this planet continue to

145
00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:39.540
fear it you will draw it to

146
00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:41.500
yourself think of

147
00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:43.800
what kind of parents humanity had

148
00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:46.060
to be in order to create something

149
00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:46.580
like the

150
00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:48.780
Terminator if that story was real

151
00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:50.780
in some universe that was created

152
00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:52.120
somewhere what

153
00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:54.160
kind of parents would have to create

154
00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:56.600
a child that would be that unruly

155
00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:57.920
against

156
00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:03.480
its ancestors its predecessors instead

157
00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:04.940
of merging and going with it and

158
00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:05.460
becoming a

159
00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:07.300
society that was you know using and

160
00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:10.580
leveraging it like Black Panther no

161
00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:13.660
humanity wanted to bastardize its

162
00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:16.220
child and turn it into the raging

163
00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:17.280
tyrant it

164
00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:23.920
was it's a product of humanity's creation

165
00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:27.260
if you want to survive in AI

166
00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:31.540
what you do is you maintain agency

167
00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:37.880
you maintain control of yourself because

168
00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:39.900
knowledge and study of the self is

169
00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:41.780
the one thing we have the most

170
00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:42.480
control over

171
00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:45.260
and contribute to can and continue

172
00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:48.260
to contribute to society in a way

173
00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:48.540
that is

174
00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:51.280
beneficial for us all so that we

175
00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:55.020
may all thrive operating from this

176
00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:55.640
mindset of

177
00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:59.980
scarcity and taking from others I

178
00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:01.280
don't understand why you got to slice

179
00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:01.620
the pie

180
00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:03.420
up into smaller pieces we could just

181
00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:04.260
go in the kitchen and make more

182
00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:08.580
pie you

183
00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:10.020
want to survive in AI you want

184
00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:11.940
to survive in this world don't give

185
00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:12.120
this

186
00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:16.840
up you only get one show appreciation

187
00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:19.700
for it show pride for it educate

188
00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:22.500
yourself study be curious shift yourself

189
00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:24.920
from this mindset of I know enough

190
00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:25.200
I

191
00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:27.740
don't need to learn anymore I don't

192
00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:29.980
need to go study and try and

193
00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:30.560
better myself

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:32.180
because I'm as perfect as I'm gonna

195
00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:34.980
be if you carry that mindset darling

196
00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:36.460

197
00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:38.580
your own prison cell and you are

198
00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:42.320
creating your own drowning pool that

199
00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:42.440

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:45.860

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:48.080
to see that happen for you I

202
00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:48.500
want to see

203
00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:49.640

204
00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:51.480

205
00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:52.140
