1
00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:40.500
The history of the tablets translated

2
00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.540
in the following pages is strange

3
00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:43.260
and beyond the

4
00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:44.920
belief of modern scientists.

5
00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:47.860
Their antiquity is stupendous, dating

6
00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:50.440
back some 36,000 years BC.

7
00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:54.200
The writer is Thoth, an Atlantean

8
00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.160
priest-king who founded a colony in

9
00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.300
ancient Egypt after

10
00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.300
the sinking of the mother country.

11
00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:01.580
He was the builder of the Great

12
00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:04.320
Pyramid of Giza, erroneously attributed

13
00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:05.220
to Cheops.

14
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.920
In it he incorporated his knowledge

15
00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.100
of the ancient wisdom and also securely secreted

16
00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.640
records and instruments of ancient Atlantis.

17
00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.900
For some 16,000 years he ruled

18
00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:19.660
the ancient race of Egypt, from approximately

19
00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:20.980
52,000 BC

20
00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:22.860
to 36,000 BC.

21
00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.840
At that time, the ancient barbarous

22
00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:27.640
race among which he and his followers

23
00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:28.800
had settled had

24
00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:31.020
been raised to a high degree of civilization.

25
00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.660
Thoth was an immortal, that is, he

26
00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:37.140
had conquered death, passing only

27
00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.580
when he willed and even

28
00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:40.000
then not through death.

29
00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:42.700
His vast wisdom made him ruler over

30
00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:45.360
the various Atlantean colonies, including

31
00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:46.160
the ones in

32
00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:47.760
South and Central America.

33
00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.160
When the time came for him to

34
00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:51.940
leave Egypt, he erected the Great

35
00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:53.380
Pyramid over the entrance

36
00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:55.820
to the Great Halls of Amenti, placed

37
00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:58.100
in it his records and appointed guards

38
00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.560
for his

39
00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.440
secrets from among the highest of

40
00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.980
his people.

41
00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:03.940
In later times, the descendants of

42
00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:06.300
these guards became the Pyramid Priest,

43
00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:07.720
by which Thoth

44
00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:10.560
was deified as the God of Wisdom,

45
00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:13.060
the Recorder, by those in the Age

46
00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:14.320
of Darkness which followed

47
00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:15.020
his passing.

48
00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.180
In legend, the Halls of Amenti became

49
00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.700
the Underworld, the Halls of the Gods,

50
00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.440
where the

51
00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.720
soul passed after death for judgment.

52
00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.420
During later ages, the ego of Thoth

53
00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.480
passed into the bodies of men in

54
00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:30.500
the manner described

55
00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:31.200
in the tablets.

56
00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.580
As such, he incarnated three times,

57
00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.060
in his last being known as Hermes

58
00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:38.240
the Thrice-Born.

59
00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:41.180
In this incarnation, he left the writings

60
00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:43.840
known to modern occultists as the Emerald

61
00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:47.300
Tablets, a later and far lesser exposition

62
00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:48.640
of the ancient mysteries.

63
00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:52.080
The tablets translated in this work

64
00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:53.920
are ten which were left in the

65
00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:55.000
Great Pyramid in the

66
00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.460
custody of the Pyramid Priest.

67
00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:58.840
The ten are divided into thirteen

68
00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:00.480
parts for the sake of convenience.

69
00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:02.980
The last two are so great and

70
00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:05.060
far-reaching in their import that

71
00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:06.620
at present it is forbidden

72
00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:09.140
to release them to the world at large.

73
00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.920
However, in those contained herein

74
00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:14.660
are secrets which will prove of inestimable

75
00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:15.760
value to the

76
00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:16.560
serious student.

77
00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:19.620
They should be read not once, but

78
00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:21.440
a hundred times for only thus can

79
00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:22.280
the true meaning be

80
00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.720
revealed.

81
00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.180
A casual reading will give glimpses

82
00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:27.720
of beauty, but more intensive study

83
00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:28.740
will open avenues

84
00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:31.240
of wisdom to the seeker.

85
00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:34.200
But now, a word as to how

86
00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.520
these mighty secrets came to be revealed

87
00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:38.080
to modern man after being

88
00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:39.220
hidden so long.

89
00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:42.220
Some thirteen hundred years B.C.,

90
00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:45.440
Egypt, the ancient Khem, was in turmoil

91
00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:46.680
and many delegations

92
00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:48.720
of priests were sent to other parts

93
00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:49.320
of the world.

94
00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:51.980
Among these were some of the Pyramid

95
00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:53.980
Priests who carried with them the

96
00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:54.780
Emerald Tablets

97
00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:56.900
as a talisman by which they could

98
00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:00.340
exercise authority over the less advanced priestcraft

99
00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:03.660
of races descended from other Atlantean colonies.

100
00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:06.340
The tablets were understood from legend

101
00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:08.720
to give the bearer authority from Thoth.

102
00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:12.060
The particular group of priests bearing

103
00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:14.900
the tablets immigrated to South America where

104
00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:17.220
they found a flourishing race, the

105
00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:20.020
Maya, who remembered much of the ancient wisdom.

106
00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:22.600
Among these, the priests settled and remained.

107
00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:25.100
In the tenth century, the Maya had

108
00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:27.280
thoroughly settled the Yucatan, and

109
00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:27.980
the tablets were

110
00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:29.700
placed beneath the altar of one of

111
00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:31.300
the great temples of the sun god.

112
00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:34.140
After the conquest of the Maya by

113
00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:36.300
the Spaniards, the cities were abandoned

114
00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:37.000
and the treasures

115
00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.280
of the temples forgotten.

116
00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:41.620
It should be understood that the Great

117
00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:44.200
Pyramid of Egypt has been, and still

118
00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:45.200
is a temple of

119
00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:46.940
initiation into the mysteries.

120
00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:51.520
Jesus, Solomon, Apollonius, and others

121
00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:52.720
were initiated there.

122
00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.220
The writer, who has a connection with

123
00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:57.300
the Great White Lodge, which also

124
00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:57.960
works through

125
00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:00.280
the Pyramid Priesthood, was instructed

126
00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:02.700
to recover and return to the Great

127
00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:03.300
Pyramid the

128
00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:04.060
ancient tablets.

129
00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:07.000
This, after adventures which need

130
00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.400
not be detailed here, was accomplished.

131
00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:12.420
Before returning them, he was given

132
00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:14.520
permission to translate and retain

133
00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:15.700
a copy of the wisdom

134
00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:16.980
engraved on the tablets.

135
00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:21.200
This was done in 1925, and only

136
00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:23.120
now has permission been given for

137
00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:24.260
part to be published.

138
00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:27.200
It is expected that many will scoff,

139
00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:29.940
yet the true student will read between

140
00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:30.660
the lines and

141
00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:31.380
gain wisdom.

142
00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:34.180
If the light is in you, the

143
00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:36.260
light which is engraved in these tablets

144
00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:37.320
will respond.

145
00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:41.140
Now, a word as to the material

146
00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:42.640
aspect of the tablets.

147
00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:45.520
They consist of twelve tablets of

148
00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:47.920
emerald green formed from a substance

149
00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:48.820
created through

150
00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:50.560
an alchemical transmutation.

151
00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:54.360
They are imperishable, resistant to

152
00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:56.080
all elements and substances.

153
00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:59.000
In effect, the atomic and cellular

154
00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.880
structure is fixed, no change ever

155
00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:02.720
taking place.

156
00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:05.140
In this respect, they violate the

157
00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:07.020
material law of ionization.

158
00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:09.520
Upon them are engraved characters

159
00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:11.640
in the ancient Atlantean language.

160
00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:14.620
Characters which respond to attuned

161
00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:17.260
thought waves, releasing the associated

162
00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:18.220
mental vibration

163
00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:19.460
in the mind of the reader.

164
00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:21.900
The tablets are fastened together

165
00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:23.960
with hoops of golden-colored alloy

166
00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:25.760
suspended from a rod

167
00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:26.940
of the same material.

168
00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:29.720
So much for the material appearance.

169
00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:33.060
The wisdom contained therein is the

170
00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:34.820
foundation of the ancient mysteries,

171
00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:36.320
and for the one

172
00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:38.520
who reads with open eyes and mind,

173
00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:41.840
his wisdom shall be increased a hundredfold.

174
00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:46.220
Read, believe or not, but read, and

175
00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:48.340
the vibration found therein will awaken

176
00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:49.620
a response in your

177
00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:49.980
soul.

178
00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:54.440
In cosmic harmony, Duriel, Supreme

179
00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:55.760
Voice of the Brotherhood.

180
00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:01.740
In the following pages, I will reveal

181
00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:03.560
some of the mysteries which as yet

182
00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:04.320
have only been

183
00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:06.400
touched upon lightly either by myself,

184
00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:09.260
or other teachers or students of truth.

185
00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.140
Man's search for understanding of

186
00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:14.120
the laws which regulate his life have

187
00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:14.900
been unending.

188
00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:17.880
Yet, always, just beyond the veil

189
00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:19.740
which shields the higher planes from

190
00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:21.080
material man's vision,

191
00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:24.080
the truth has existed, ready to be

192
00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:26.700
assimilated by those who enlarge their

193
00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:27.660
vision by turning

194
00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:30.360
inward, not outward, in their search.

195
00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:33.440
In the silence of material senses

196
00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:35.960
lies the key to the unveiling of wisdom.

197
00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:38.240
He who talks does not know.

198
00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:40.420
He who knows does not talk.

199
00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:43.160
The highest knowledge is unutterable,

200
00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:45.780
for it exists as an entity in

201
00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:47.140
lanes which transcend

202
00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:49.440
all material words or symbols.

203
00:07:50.380 --> 00:07:52.820
All symbols are but keys to doors

204
00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:55.360
leading to truths, and many times

205
00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:56.320
the door is not

206
00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:58.520
opened because the key seems so great

207
00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:00.240
that the things which are beyond it

208
00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:01.080
are not visible.

209
00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:03.840
If we can understand that all keys,

210
00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:07.100
all material symbols or manifestations

211
00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:08.880
are but extensions

212
00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:10.900
of a great law and truth, we

213
00:08:10.900 --> 00:08:12.800
will begin to develop the vision which

214
00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:13.980
will enable us to

215
00:08:13.980 --> 00:08:15.360
penetrate beyond the veil.

216
00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:18.660
All things in all universes move according

217
00:08:18.660 --> 00:08:21.120
to law, and the law which regulates

218
00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:21.660
the movement

219
00:08:21.660 --> 00:08:23.560
of the planets is no more immutable

220
00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:26.720
than the law which regulates the material expressions

221
00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:27.440
of man.

222
00:08:28.550 --> 00:08:30.860
One of the greatest of all cosmic

223
00:08:30.860 --> 00:08:32.960
laws is that which is responsible

224
00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:33.940
for the formation

225
00:08:33.940 --> 00:08:35.920
of man as a material being.

226
00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:38.560
The great aim of the mystery schools

227
00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:40.640
of all ages has been to reveal

228
00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:41.740
the workings of the

229
00:08:41.740 --> 00:08:43.780
law which connect man the material

230
00:08:43.780 --> 00:08:45.360
and man the spiritual.

231
00:08:46.060 --> 00:08:48.540
The connecting link between the material

232
00:08:48.540 --> 00:08:51.340
man and the spiritual man is the intellectual

233
00:08:51.340 --> 00:08:54.080
man, for the mind partakes of both

234
00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:56.480
the material and immaterial qualities.

235
00:08:57.320 --> 00:08:59.220
The aspirant for higher knowledge

236
00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:01.240
must develop the intellectual side

237
00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:02.820
of his nature and so

238
00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:05.000
strengthen his will that it is able

239
00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.720
to concentrate all powers of his being

240
00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:09.640
on and in the plane

241
00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:10.400
he desires.

242
00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:13.820
The great search for light, life and

243
00:09:13.820 --> 00:09:16.740
love only begins on the material plane.

244
00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:19.800
Carried to its ultimate, its final

245
00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:21.900
goal is complete oneness with the

246
00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:23.140
universal consciousness.

247
00:09:23.860 --> 00:09:25.780
The foundation in the material is

248
00:09:25.780 --> 00:09:26.660
the first step.

249
00:09:27.220 --> 00:09:30.120
Then comes the higher goal of spiritual attainment.

250
00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:32.880
In the following pages I will give

251
00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:34.960
an interpretation of the Emerald Tablets

252
00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:36.420
and their secret, hidden

253
00:09:36.420 --> 00:09:37.920
and esoteric meanings.

254
00:09:38.540 --> 00:09:40.420
Concealed in the words of Thoth are

255
00:09:40.420 --> 00:09:42.240
many meanings that do not appear on

256
00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:42.700
the surface.

257
00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:45.220
Light of knowledge brought to bear

258
00:09:45.220 --> 00:09:47.120
upon the tablets will open many new

259
00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:48.100
fields for thought.

260
00:09:48.820 --> 00:09:51.700
Read and be wise, but only if

261
00:09:51.700 --> 00:09:53.280
the light of your own consciousness

262
00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:54.980
awakens the deep-seated

263
00:09:54.980 --> 00:09:56.820
understanding which is an inherent

264
00:09:56.820 --> 00:09:58.220
quality of the soul.

265
00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:01.400
In the threefold light, Duryodhana.

266
00:10:08.660 --> 00:10:12.280
I, Thoth the Atlantean, Master of

267
00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:14.920
Mysteries, Keeper of Records, Mighty

268
00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:16.600
King, Magician

269
00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:18.800
living from generation to generation,

270
00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:21.280
being about to pass into the halls

271
00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:22.840
of Amenti, set

272
00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:24.720
down for the guidance of those that

273
00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:27.180
are to come after, these records of

274
00:10:27.180 --> 00:10:28.040
the mighty wisdom

275
00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:29.520
of Great Atlantis.

276
00:10:30.340 --> 00:10:32.080
In the great city of Kiur on

277
00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:34.220
the island of Undal, in a time

278
00:10:34.220 --> 00:10:36.620
far past, I began this incarnation.

279
00:10:36.620 --> 00:10:38.640
Not as the little men of the

280
00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:40.340
present age did the mighty ones of

281
00:10:40.340 --> 00:10:41.480
Atlantis live and die,

282
00:10:41.860 --> 00:10:44.320
but rather from eon to eon did

283
00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:45.880
they renew their life in the halls

284
00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:46.780
of Amenti where the

285
00:10:46.780 --> 00:10:48.920
river of life flows eternally onward.

286
00:10:49.540 --> 00:10:51.480
A hundred times ten have I descended

287
00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:53.280
the dark way that led into light,

288
00:10:53.820 --> 00:10:54.840
and as many times

289
00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:56.520
have I ascended from the darkness

290
00:10:56.520 --> 00:10:59.040
into the light, my strength and power renewed.

291
00:11:00.140 --> 00:11:02.360
Now for a time I descend, and

292
00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:04.060
the men of Khem shall know me

293
00:11:04.060 --> 00:11:04.540
no more.

294
00:11:04.540 --> 00:11:06.920
But in a time yet unborn will

295
00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:09.980
I rise again, mighty and potent, requiring

296
00:11:09.980 --> 00:11:10.640
an accounting

297
00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:12.040
of those left behind me.

298
00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:15.120
Then beware, O men of Khem, if

299
00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:16.940
ye have falsely betrayed my teaching,

300
00:11:17.380 --> 00:11:18.520
for I shall cast ye

301
00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:20.500
down from your estate into the darkness

302
00:11:20.500 --> 00:11:22.260
of the caves from whence ye came.

303
00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:24.880
Betray not my secrets to the men

304
00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:26.680
of the north, or the men of

305
00:11:26.680 --> 00:11:28.520
the south, lest my curse fall

306
00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:29.080
upon ye.

307
00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:32.360
Remember and heed my words, for surely

308
00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:34.280
I will return again and require of

309
00:11:34.280 --> 00:11:34.900
thee that which

310
00:11:34.900 --> 00:11:35.500
ye guard.

311
00:11:36.140 --> 00:11:39.020
Ay, even from beyond time and from

312
00:11:39.020 --> 00:11:41.820
beyond death will I return, rewarding

313
00:11:41.820 --> 00:11:42.740
or punishing

314
00:11:42.740 --> 00:11:45.200
as ye have requitted your trust.

315
00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:48.660
Great were my people in the ancient

316
00:11:48.660 --> 00:11:50.820
days, great beyond the conception

317
00:11:50.820 --> 00:11:51.460
of the little

318
00:11:51.460 --> 00:11:54.260
people now around me, knowing the

319
00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:56.920
wisdom of old, seeking far within

320
00:11:56.920 --> 00:11:58.140
the heart of infinity

321
00:11:58.140 --> 00:12:00.860
knowledge that belonged to earth's youth.

322
00:12:01.820 --> 00:12:03.640
Wise were we with the wisdom of

323
00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:05.320
the children of light who dwelt among

324
00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:07.140
us, strong were we

325
00:12:07.140 --> 00:12:08.960
with the power drawn from the eternal

326
00:12:08.960 --> 00:12:12.240
fire, and all of these, greatest among

327
00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:12.740
the children

328
00:12:12.740 --> 00:12:15.600
of men was my father, Thothme, keeper

329
00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:18.000
of the great temple, link between

330
00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:18.520
the children

331
00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:20.340
of light who dwelt within the temple,

332
00:12:20.820 --> 00:12:22.620
and the races of men who inhabited

333
00:12:22.620 --> 00:12:23.580
the ten islands,

334
00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:26.880
mouthpiece, after the three, of the

335
00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:29.420
dweller of Unal, speaking to the kings

336
00:12:29.420 --> 00:12:30.260
with the voice

337
00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:32.340
that must be obeyed.

338
00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:35.860
Grew I there from a child into

339
00:12:35.860 --> 00:12:38.380
manhood, being taught by my father

340
00:12:38.380 --> 00:12:40.460
the elder mysteries, until

341
00:12:40.460 --> 00:12:42.280
in time there grew within the fire

342
00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:44.920
of wisdom, until it burst into a

343
00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:45.920
consuming flame.

344
00:12:46.860 --> 00:12:49.060
Nought desired I but the attainment

345
00:12:49.060 --> 00:12:51.760
of wisdom, until on a great day

346
00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:53.140
the command came from

347
00:12:53.140 --> 00:12:54.640
the dweller of the temple that I

348
00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:57.400
be brought before him, few there were

349
00:12:57.400 --> 00:12:58.300
among the children

350
00:12:58.300 --> 00:13:00.020
of men who had looked upon that

351
00:13:00.020 --> 00:13:02.640
mighty face and lived, for not as

352
00:13:02.640 --> 00:13:03.960
the sons of men are the

353
00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:05.920
children of light when they are not

354
00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:07.820
incarnate in a physical body.

355
00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:11.560
Chosen was I from the sons of

356
00:13:11.560 --> 00:13:13.660
men, taught by the dweller so that

357
00:13:13.660 --> 00:13:14.640
his purposes might

358
00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:17.480
be fulfilled, purposes yet unborn

359
00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:18.660
in the womb of time.

360
00:13:19.300 --> 00:13:21.640
Long ages I dwelt in the temple,

361
00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:24.200
learning ever and yet ever more wisdom,

362
00:13:24.340 --> 00:13:25.200
until I too

363
00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:27.180
approached the light emitted from

364
00:13:27.180 --> 00:13:28.020
the great fire.

365
00:13:28.780 --> 00:13:30.860
Taught me he the path to Amenti,

366
00:13:31.020 --> 00:13:32.720
the underworld where the great king

367
00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:34.020
sits upon his throne

368
00:13:34.020 --> 00:13:34.620
of might.

369
00:13:35.420 --> 00:13:37.260
Deep I bowed in homage before the

370
00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:38.680
lords of life and the lords of

371
00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:39.780
death, receiving as

372
00:13:39.780 --> 00:13:41.860
my gift the key of life.

373
00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:44.100
Free was I of the halls of

374
00:13:44.100 --> 00:13:46.520
Amenti, bound not by death to the

375
00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:47.340
circle of life.

376
00:13:47.940 --> 00:13:49.980
Far to the stars I journeyed until

377
00:13:49.980 --> 00:13:51.820
space and time became as naught.

378
00:13:52.380 --> 00:13:54.520
Then having drunk deep of the cup

379
00:13:54.520 --> 00:13:56.540
of wisdom, I looked into the hearts

380
00:13:56.540 --> 00:13:57.940
of men, and there

381
00:13:57.940 --> 00:14:00.220
I found greater mysteries and was

382
00:14:00.220 --> 00:14:02.900
glad, for only in the search for

383
00:14:02.900 --> 00:14:04.160
truth could my soul

384
00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:07.440
be stilled and the flame within be quenched.

385
00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:11.780
Down through the ages I lived, seeing

386
00:14:11.780 --> 00:14:13.700
those around me taste of the cup

387
00:14:13.700 --> 00:14:14.940
of death and return

388
00:14:14.940 --> 00:14:16.720
again in the light of life.

389
00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:19.480
Gradually from the kingdoms of Atlantis

390
00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:21.800
passed ways of consciousness that

391
00:14:21.800 --> 00:14:22.680
had been one with

392
00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:25.900
me, only to be replaced by spawn

393
00:14:25.900 --> 00:14:27.220
of a lower star.

394
00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:30.560
In obedience to the law, the word

395
00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:32.400
of the master grew into flower.

396
00:14:33.340 --> 00:14:35.460
Downward into the darkness turned

397
00:14:35.460 --> 00:14:37.540
the thoughts of the Atlanteans, until

398
00:14:37.540 --> 00:14:38.980
at last in this wrath

399
00:14:38.980 --> 00:14:41.420
arose from his aguanti the dweller.

400
00:14:42.380 --> 00:14:45.380
Speaking the word, calling the power,

401
00:14:45.780 --> 00:14:48.600
deep in earth's heart the sons of

402
00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:49.500
Amenti heard,

403
00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:52.120
and hearing, directing the changing

404
00:14:52.120 --> 00:14:54.100
of the flower of fire that burns

405
00:14:54.100 --> 00:14:55.740
eternally, changing

406
00:14:55.740 --> 00:14:58.840
and shifting, using the logos, until

407
00:14:58.840 --> 00:15:01.280
the great fire changed its direction.

408
00:15:02.860 --> 00:15:05.060
Over the world then broke the great

409
00:15:05.060 --> 00:15:08.160
waters, drowning and sinking, changing

410
00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:09.260
earth's balance

411
00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:11.340
until only the temple of light was

412
00:15:11.340 --> 00:15:13.240
left standing on the great mountain

413
00:15:13.240 --> 00:15:15.220
on Undal, still rising

414
00:15:15.220 --> 00:15:16.100
out of the water.

415
00:15:16.920 --> 00:15:19.420
Some there were who were living, saved

416
00:15:19.420 --> 00:15:21.140
from the rush of the fountains.

417
00:15:21.820 --> 00:15:24.280
Called to me then the master, saying,

418
00:15:24.900 --> 00:15:26.460
Gather ye together my people.

419
00:15:27.140 --> 00:15:28.640
Take them by the arch ye have

420
00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:30.380
learned of far across the waters,

421
00:15:30.740 --> 00:15:32.140
until ye reach the land

422
00:15:32.140 --> 00:15:34.040
of the hairy barbarians, dwelling

423
00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:35.340
in caves of the desert.

424
00:15:35.340 --> 00:15:38.320
Follow there the plan that ye know of.

425
00:15:39.980 --> 00:15:41.840
Gathered I then my people, and entered

426
00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:43.300
the great ship of the master.

427
00:15:43.780 --> 00:15:45.540
Upward we rose into the morning.

428
00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:49.000
Dark beneath us lay the temple, suddenly

429
00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.780
over it rose the waters, vanished

430
00:15:51.780 --> 00:15:53.320
from earth, until

431
00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:55.580
the time appointed was the great temple.

432
00:15:56.880 --> 00:15:58.500
Fast we fled toward the sun of

433
00:15:58.500 --> 00:16:00.380
the morning, until beneath us lay

434
00:16:00.380 --> 00:16:01.420
the land of the children

435
00:16:01.420 --> 00:16:01.980
of Khem.

436
00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:04.640
Raging, they came with cudgels and

437
00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:07.180
spears, lifted in anger, seeking to

438
00:16:07.180 --> 00:16:08.120
slay and utterly

439
00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:10.180
destroy the sons of Atlantis.

440
00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:13.820
Then raised I my staff, and directed

441
00:16:13.820 --> 00:16:16.240
a ray of vibration, striking them

442
00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:16.940
still in their

443
00:16:16.940 --> 00:16:19.220
tracks as fragments of stone of the mountain.

444
00:16:20.180 --> 00:16:22.280
Then spoke I to them in words

445
00:16:22.280 --> 00:16:24.780
calm and peaceful, telling them of

446
00:16:24.780 --> 00:16:27.060
the might of Atlantis, saying

447
00:16:27.060 --> 00:16:28.920
we were children of the sun and

448
00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:29.780
its messengers.

449
00:16:30.500 --> 00:16:32.600
Cowled I them by my display of

450
00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:35.140
magic science, until at my feet they

451
00:16:35.140 --> 00:16:36.700
grovelled, when I released

452
00:16:36.700 --> 00:16:37.060
them.

453
00:16:39.380 --> 00:16:41.440
Long dwelt we in the land of

454
00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:44.580
Khem, long and yet long again, until

455
00:16:44.580 --> 00:16:45.600
obeying the commands

456
00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:47.340
of the master, who while sleeping

457
00:16:47.340 --> 00:16:49.800
yet lives eternally, I sent from me

458
00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:51.160
the sons of Atlantis,

459
00:16:51.580 --> 00:16:53.920
sent them in many directions, that

460
00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:55.980
from the womb of time wisdom might

461
00:16:55.980 --> 00:16:57.320
rise again in her

462
00:16:57.320 --> 00:16:57.740
children.

463
00:16:58.500 --> 00:17:00.720
Long time dwelt I in the land

464
00:17:00.720 --> 00:17:03.140
of Khem, doing great works by the

465
00:17:03.140 --> 00:17:04.100
wisdom within me.

466
00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:06.740
Upward grew into the light of knowledge

467
00:17:06.740 --> 00:17:09.160
the children of Khem, watered by the

468
00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:09.640
rains of

469
00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:10.240
my wisdom.

470
00:17:11.420 --> 00:17:13.580
Blasted I then a path to Amenti,

471
00:17:13.680 --> 00:17:15.360
so that I might retain my powers,

472
00:17:15.700 --> 00:17:16.900
living from age to

473
00:17:16.900 --> 00:17:19.860
age a son of Atlantis, keeping the

474
00:17:19.860 --> 00:17:22.040
wisdom, preserving the records.

475
00:17:23.680 --> 00:17:26.700
Great grew the sons of Khem, conquering

476
00:17:26.700 --> 00:17:29.700
the people around them, growing slowly upwards

477
00:17:29.700 --> 00:17:30.800
in soul force.

478
00:17:31.540 --> 00:17:33.140
Now for a time I go from

479
00:17:33.140 --> 00:17:34.940
among them into the dark halls of

480
00:17:34.940 --> 00:17:37.360
Amenti, deep in the halls of

481
00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:39.780
the earth, before the lords of the

482
00:17:39.780 --> 00:17:42.380
powers, face to face once again with

483
00:17:42.380 --> 00:17:42.880
the dweller.

484
00:17:43.860 --> 00:17:45.980
Raised I high over the entrance a

485
00:17:45.980 --> 00:17:48.620
doorway, a gateway leading down to Amenti.

486
00:17:48.620 --> 00:17:51.240
Few there would be with courage to

487
00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:53.420
dare it, few pass the portal to

488
00:17:53.420 --> 00:17:54.240
dark Amenti.

489
00:17:54.880 --> 00:17:57.280
Raised over the passage I a mighty

490
00:17:57.280 --> 00:18:00.120
pyramid, using the power that overcomes

491
00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:01.020
earth force.

492
00:18:01.800 --> 00:18:04.140
Deep and yet deeper place I a

493
00:18:04.140 --> 00:18:07.200
force house or chamber, from it carved

494
00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:08.760
I a circular passage

495
00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:10.880
reaching almost to the great summit.

496
00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:13.560
There in the apex set I the

497
00:18:13.560 --> 00:18:16.000
crystal, sending the ray into the

498
00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:18.160
time space, drawing the force

499
00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:20.580
from out of the ether, concentrating

500
00:18:20.580 --> 00:18:22.960
upon the gateway to Amenti.

501
00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:26.280
Other chambers I built and left vacant

502
00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:28.840
to all seeming yet hidden within them

503
00:18:28.840 --> 00:18:29.440
are the

504
00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:30.520
keys to Amenti.

505
00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:33.420
He who in courage would dare the

506
00:18:33.420 --> 00:18:36.260
dark realms, let him be purified first

507
00:18:36.260 --> 00:18:37.340
by long fasting.

508
00:18:38.140 --> 00:18:40.340
Lie in the sarcophagus of stone in

509
00:18:40.340 --> 00:18:43.340
my chamber, then reveal I to him

510
00:18:43.340 --> 00:18:44.260
the great mysteries.

511
00:18:44.860 --> 00:18:47.060
Soon shall he follow to where I

512
00:18:47.060 --> 00:18:49.380
shall meet him, even in the darkness

513
00:18:49.380 --> 00:18:50.600
of earth shall I

514
00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:54.020
meet him, I, Thoth, lord of wisdom,

515
00:18:54.420 --> 00:18:56.540
meet him and hold him and dwell

516
00:18:56.540 --> 00:18:57.540
with him always.

517
00:18:58.480 --> 00:19:01.520
Built I the great pyramid, patterned

518
00:19:01.520 --> 00:19:03.500
after the pyramid of earth force,

519
00:19:03.980 --> 00:19:05.040
burning eternally

520
00:19:05.040 --> 00:19:07.000
so that it too might remain through

521
00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:07.580
the ages.

522
00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:10.320
In it I built my knowledge of

523
00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:12.200
magic science so that I might be

524
00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:13.700
here when again I return

525
00:19:13.700 --> 00:19:16.600
from Amenti, I, while I sleep in

526
00:19:16.600 --> 00:19:18.540
the halls of Amenti my soul roaming

527
00:19:18.540 --> 00:19:20.020
free will incarnate,

528
00:19:20.540 --> 00:19:23.260
dwell among men in this form or another.

529
00:19:25.100 --> 00:19:27.140
Emissary on earth am I of the

530
00:19:27.140 --> 00:19:29.480
dweller, fulfilling his commands so

531
00:19:29.480 --> 00:19:30.720
many might be lifted.

532
00:19:31.740 --> 00:19:33.500
Now return I to the halls of

533
00:19:33.500 --> 00:19:35.840
Amenti, leaving behind me some of

534
00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:36.380
my wisdom.

535
00:19:37.260 --> 00:19:39.380
Preserve ye and keep ye the command

536
00:19:39.380 --> 00:19:40.040
of the dweller.

537
00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:44.080
Lift ever upwards your eyes toward

538
00:19:44.080 --> 00:19:44.760
the light.

539
00:19:45.340 --> 00:19:48.100
Surely in time ye are one with

540
00:19:48.100 --> 00:19:50.940
the master, surely by right ye are

541
00:19:50.940 --> 00:19:51.960
one with the master,

542
00:19:52.580 --> 00:19:54.860
surely by right ye are one with

543
00:19:54.860 --> 00:19:55.360
the all.

544
00:19:56.260 --> 00:19:59.080
Now I depart from ye, know my

545
00:19:59.080 --> 00:20:01.360
commandments, keep them and be them,

546
00:20:01.620 --> 00:20:02.480
and I will be with

547
00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:04.500
you, helping and guiding you into

548
00:20:04.500 --> 00:20:05.020
the light.

549
00:20:05.580 --> 00:20:07.520
Now before me opens the portal.

550
00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:10.160
Go I down in the darkness of

551
00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:11.320
the night.

552
00:20:18.380 --> 00:20:20.660
Deep in earth's heart lie the halls

553
00:20:20.660 --> 00:20:23.180
of Amenti, far neath the islands of

554
00:20:23.180 --> 00:20:24.140
sunken Atlantis,

555
00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:26.300
halls of the dead and halls of

556
00:20:26.300 --> 00:20:28.760
the living, bathed in fire of the

557
00:20:28.760 --> 00:20:29.580
infinite all.

558
00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:33.020
Far in a past time, lost in

559
00:20:33.020 --> 00:20:35.020
the space-time, the children of light

560
00:20:35.020 --> 00:20:36.500
looked down on the world,

561
00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:39.040
seeing the children of men in their

562
00:20:39.040 --> 00:20:41.240
bondage, bound by the force that came

563
00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:42.020
from beyond.

564
00:20:42.860 --> 00:20:45.100
Knew they that only by freedom from

565
00:20:45.100 --> 00:20:47.420
bondage could man ever rise from earth

566
00:20:47.420 --> 00:20:48.240
to the sun.

567
00:20:48.840 --> 00:20:50.980
Down they descended and created bodies,

568
00:20:51.480 --> 00:20:54.060
taking the semblances of men as their own.

569
00:20:54.560 --> 00:20:56.860
The masters of everything said after

570
00:20:56.860 --> 00:20:57.540
their forming,

571
00:20:57.800 --> 00:21:00.400
We are they who were formed from

572
00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:02.660
the space-dust, partaking of life

573
00:21:02.660 --> 00:21:03.800
from the infinite all,

574
00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:06.020
living in the world as children of

575
00:21:06.020 --> 00:21:08.860
men, like and yet unlike the children

576
00:21:08.860 --> 00:21:09.480
of men.

577
00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:13.360
Then for a dwelling-place far neath

578
00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:15.960
the earth-crust blasted great spaces

579
00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:17.180
they by their power,

580
00:21:17.740 --> 00:21:19.640
spaces apart from the children of

581
00:21:19.640 --> 00:21:22.780
men, surrounded them by forces and power,

582
00:21:22.780 --> 00:21:25.260
shielded from harm they the halls

583
00:21:25.260 --> 00:21:26.020
of the dead.

584
00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:29.320
Side by side then placed they other

585
00:21:29.320 --> 00:21:32.080
spaces, filled them with life and

586
00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:33.460
with light from above.

587
00:21:34.280 --> 00:21:36.320
Builded they then the halls of Amenti,

588
00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:38.820
that they might dwell eternally there,

589
00:21:39.360 --> 00:21:41.780
living with life to eternity's end.

590
00:21:42.680 --> 00:21:44.580
Thirty and two were there of the

591
00:21:44.580 --> 00:21:47.000
children, sons of lights who had come

592
00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:47.720
among men,

593
00:21:47.720 --> 00:21:50.080
seeking to free from the bondage of

594
00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:52.660
darkness those who were bound by the

595
00:21:52.660 --> 00:21:53.900
force from beyond.

596
00:21:55.020 --> 00:21:57.100
Deep in the halls of life grew

597
00:21:57.100 --> 00:22:00.460
a flower, flaming, expanding, driving

598
00:22:00.460 --> 00:22:01.560
backward the night.

599
00:22:02.300 --> 00:22:04.080
Placed in the center a ray of

600
00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:07.380
great potence, life-giving, light-giving,

601
00:22:07.940 --> 00:22:10.260
filling with power all who came near it.

602
00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:13.260
Placed they around it thrones two

603
00:22:13.260 --> 00:22:15.720
and thirty, places for each of the

604
00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:16.560
children of light,

605
00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:18.820
placed so that they were bathed in

606
00:22:18.820 --> 00:22:20.700
the radiance filled with the life

607
00:22:20.700 --> 00:22:22.060
from the eternal light.

608
00:22:22.880 --> 00:22:25.000
There time after time placed they

609
00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:26.860
their first created bodies so that

610
00:22:26.860 --> 00:22:27.760
they might be filled

611
00:22:27.760 --> 00:22:29.140
with the spirit of life.

612
00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:32.020
One hundred years out of each thousand

613
00:22:32.020 --> 00:22:34.400
must the life-giving light flame forth

614
00:22:34.400 --> 00:22:35.200
on their bodies,

615
00:22:35.780 --> 00:22:38.460
quickening, awakening the spirit of life.

616
00:22:39.780 --> 00:22:42.260
There in the circle from aeon to

617
00:22:42.260 --> 00:22:44.200
aeon sit the great masters,

618
00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:46.940
living a life not known among men.

619
00:22:47.740 --> 00:22:49.860
There in the halls of life they

620
00:22:49.860 --> 00:22:52.840
lie sleeping, free flows their soul

621
00:22:52.840 --> 00:22:54.340
through the bodies of men.

622
00:22:55.060 --> 00:22:57.360
Time after time, while their bodies

623
00:22:57.360 --> 00:22:59.820
lie sleeping, incarnate they in the

624
00:22:59.820 --> 00:23:00.720
bodies of men,

625
00:23:01.360 --> 00:23:03.600
teaching and guiding onward and upward,

626
00:23:03.920 --> 00:23:05.800
out of the darkness into the light.

627
00:23:06.620 --> 00:23:08.220
There in the hall of life, filled

628
00:23:08.220 --> 00:23:10.340
with their wisdom, known not to the

629
00:23:10.340 --> 00:23:11.200
races of man,

630
00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:13.980
living forever neath the cold fire

631
00:23:13.980 --> 00:23:16.680
of life, sit the children of light.

632
00:23:17.520 --> 00:23:19.620
Times there are when they awaken,

633
00:23:19.900 --> 00:23:21.580
come from the depths to be lights

634
00:23:21.580 --> 00:23:22.240
among men,

635
00:23:22.820 --> 00:23:24.940
infinite they among finite.

636
00:23:26.780 --> 00:23:29.060
He who by progress has grown from

637
00:23:29.060 --> 00:23:31.160
the darkness, lifted himself from

638
00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:32.620
the night into light,

639
00:23:33.080 --> 00:23:34.780
free is he made of the halls

640
00:23:34.780 --> 00:23:37.220
of Amenti, free of the flower of

641
00:23:37.220 --> 00:23:38.600
light and of life.

642
00:23:39.280 --> 00:23:42.000
Guided he then by wisdom and knowledge

643
00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:44.360
passes from men to the master of life.

644
00:23:45.140 --> 00:23:47.000
There he may dwell as one with

645
00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:49.040
the masters, free from the bonds of

646
00:23:49.040 --> 00:23:50.140
the darkness of night.

647
00:23:51.080 --> 00:23:53.080
Seated within the flower of radiance

648
00:23:53.080 --> 00:23:55.440
sit seven lords from the space-times

649
00:23:55.440 --> 00:23:56.160
above us,

650
00:23:56.700 --> 00:23:58.740
helping and guiding through infinite

651
00:23:58.740 --> 00:24:01.240
wisdom the pathway through the time

652
00:24:01.240 --> 00:24:02.420
of the children of men.

653
00:24:03.220 --> 00:24:06.080
Mighty and strange they, veiled with

654
00:24:06.080 --> 00:24:09.060
their power, silent, all-knowing,

655
00:24:09.520 --> 00:24:11.760
drawing the life-force, different,

656
00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:14.360
yet one with the children of men.

657
00:24:15.040 --> 00:24:18.480
Ay, different, and yet one with the

658
00:24:18.480 --> 00:24:19.480
children of light.

659
00:24:21.320 --> 00:24:23.680
Custodians and watchers of the force

660
00:24:23.680 --> 00:24:26.460
of man's bondage, ready to loose when

661
00:24:26.460 --> 00:24:27.400
the light has been

662
00:24:27.400 --> 00:24:30.640
reached, first and most mighty sits

663
00:24:30.640 --> 00:24:33.400
the veiled presence, lord of lords,

664
00:24:33.780 --> 00:24:35.020
the infinite nine,

665
00:24:35.480 --> 00:24:37.980
over the other from each cosmic cycle,

666
00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:40.200
weighing and watching the progress

667
00:24:40.200 --> 00:24:40.820
of men.

668
00:24:41.580 --> 00:24:44.060
Under he sits the lord of the

669
00:24:44.060 --> 00:24:47.420
cycles, three, four, five, and six,

670
00:24:47.620 --> 00:24:48.540
seven, eight,

671
00:24:48.740 --> 00:24:51.080
each with his mission, each with his

672
00:24:51.080 --> 00:24:53.960
power, guiding, directing the destiny

673
00:24:53.960 --> 00:24:54.640
of man.

674
00:24:55.360 --> 00:24:57.380
There sit they, mighty and potent,

675
00:24:57.720 --> 00:25:00.340
free of all time and space, not

676
00:25:00.340 --> 00:25:01.320
of this world they,

677
00:25:01.680 --> 00:25:04.600
yet akin to it, elder brothers they

678
00:25:04.600 --> 00:25:07.820
of the children of men, judging and weighing,

679
00:25:08.680 --> 00:25:10.860
they with their wisdom, watching the

680
00:25:10.860 --> 00:25:13.020
progress of light among men.

681
00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:16.480
There before them was I led by

682
00:25:16.480 --> 00:25:18.500
the dweller, watched him blend with

683
00:25:18.500 --> 00:25:19.520
one from above,

684
00:25:19.520 --> 00:25:21.860
then from he came forth a voice

685
00:25:21.860 --> 00:25:24.520
saying, Great art thou thought among

686
00:25:24.520 --> 00:25:25.500
children of men,

687
00:25:26.220 --> 00:25:28.620
free henceforth of the halls of Amenti,

688
00:25:29.040 --> 00:25:31.420
master of life among children of men.

689
00:25:32.180 --> 00:25:34.120
Taste not of death except as thou

690
00:25:34.120 --> 00:25:36.340
will it, drink thou of life to

691
00:25:36.340 --> 00:25:37.360
eternity's end,

692
00:25:37.840 --> 00:25:40.220
henceforth forever is life, thine

693
00:25:40.220 --> 00:25:43.080
for the taking, henceforth is death

694
00:25:43.080 --> 00:25:44.720
at the call of thy hand.

695
00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:47.400
Dwell here or leave here when thou

696
00:25:47.400 --> 00:25:50.360
desirest, free is Amenti to the son

697
00:25:50.360 --> 00:25:50.940
of man.

698
00:25:51.720 --> 00:25:53.700
Take thou up life in what form

699
00:25:53.700 --> 00:25:56.120
thou desirest, child of the light

700
00:25:56.120 --> 00:25:57.580
that has grown among men.

701
00:25:58.280 --> 00:26:01.140
Choose thou thy work, for all should,

702
00:26:01.280 --> 00:26:03.500
must labor, never be free from the

703
00:26:03.500 --> 00:26:04.480
pathway of light.

704
00:26:05.020 --> 00:26:07.140
One step thou hast gained on the

705
00:26:07.140 --> 00:26:09.580
long pathway upward, infinite now

706
00:26:09.580 --> 00:26:10.980
is the mountain of light.

707
00:26:11.540 --> 00:26:14.640
Each step thou taketh, but heightens

708
00:26:14.640 --> 00:26:16.920
the mountain, all of thy progress

709
00:26:16.920 --> 00:26:18.580
but lengthens the goal.

710
00:26:19.740 --> 00:26:22.000
Approach ye ever the infinite wisdom,

711
00:26:22.360 --> 00:26:24.560
ever before thee recedes the goal,

712
00:26:25.120 --> 00:26:26.280
free are ye made

713
00:26:26.280 --> 00:26:27.920
now of the halls of Amenti to

714
00:26:27.920 --> 00:26:29.580
walk hand in hand with the lords

715
00:26:29.580 --> 00:26:31.700
of the world, one in one purpose

716
00:26:31.700 --> 00:26:33.920
working together, bringers of light

717
00:26:33.920 --> 00:26:36.340
to the children of men. Then from

718
00:26:36.340 --> 00:26:37.320
his throne came

719
00:26:37.320 --> 00:26:39.360
one of his masters, taking my hand

720
00:26:39.360 --> 00:26:41.320
and leading me onward through all

721
00:26:41.320 --> 00:26:42.680
the halls of the deep hidden

722
00:26:42.680 --> 00:26:45.180
land. Led he me through the halls

723
00:26:45.180 --> 00:26:47.100
of Amenti, showing the mysteries that

724
00:26:47.100 --> 00:26:48.440
are known not to man.

725
00:26:49.040 --> 00:26:50.720
Through the dark passage downward

726
00:26:50.720 --> 00:26:53.080
he led me, into the hall where

727
00:26:53.080 --> 00:26:54.540
sits the dark death,

728
00:26:55.100 --> 00:26:57.280
vast as space lay the great hall

729
00:26:57.280 --> 00:27:00.020
before me, walled by darkness but

730
00:27:00.020 --> 00:27:01.320
yet filled with light.

731
00:27:02.160 --> 00:27:04.900
Before me arose a great throne of

732
00:27:04.900 --> 00:27:07.380
darkness, veiled on it set a figure

733
00:27:07.380 --> 00:27:07.900
of night,

734
00:27:08.560 --> 00:27:10.620
darker than darkness set the great

735
00:27:10.620 --> 00:27:13.240
figure, dark with a darkness not of

736
00:27:13.240 --> 00:27:13.680
the night.

737
00:27:14.260 --> 00:27:16.240
Before it then paused the master,

738
00:27:16.720 --> 00:27:18.360
speaking the word that brings about

739
00:27:18.360 --> 00:27:19.200
life, saying,

740
00:27:19.580 --> 00:27:21.620
O master of darkness, guide of the

741
00:27:21.620 --> 00:27:24.180
way from life unto life, before thee

742
00:27:24.180 --> 00:27:25.440
I bring a sun of the

743
00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:27.780
morning, touch him not ever with the

744
00:27:27.780 --> 00:27:30.560
power of night, call not his flame

745
00:27:30.560 --> 00:27:31.540
to the darkness of

746
00:27:31.540 --> 00:27:34.960
night, know him and see him, one

747
00:27:34.960 --> 00:27:36.940
of our brothers lifted from darkness

748
00:27:36.940 --> 00:27:39.040
into the light, release

749
00:27:39.040 --> 00:27:41.880
thou his flame from its bondage, free

750
00:27:41.880 --> 00:27:43.580
let it flame through the darkness

751
00:27:43.580 --> 00:27:44.220
of night.

752
00:27:45.800 --> 00:27:47.760
Raised then the hand of the figure

753
00:27:47.760 --> 00:27:50.120
forth came a flame that grew clear

754
00:27:50.120 --> 00:27:50.720
and bright,

755
00:27:50.720 --> 00:27:53.140
rolled back swiftly the curtain of

756
00:27:53.140 --> 00:27:55.420
darkness, unveiled the hall from the

757
00:27:55.420 --> 00:27:56.380
darkness of night,

758
00:27:56.880 --> 00:27:59.000
then grew in the great space before

759
00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:01.300
me flame after flame from the veil

760
00:28:01.300 --> 00:28:02.060
of the night.

761
00:28:02.980 --> 00:28:05.860
Uncounted millions leaped they before

762
00:28:05.860 --> 00:28:08.620
me, some flaming forth as flowers

763
00:28:08.620 --> 00:28:09.340
of fire,

764
00:28:10.100 --> 00:28:12.080
others there were that shed a dim

765
00:28:12.080 --> 00:28:14.380
radiance, flowing but faintly from

766
00:28:14.380 --> 00:28:15.300
out of the night,

767
00:28:16.020 --> 00:28:18.120
some there were that faded swiftly,

768
00:28:18.680 --> 00:28:20.600
others that grew from a small spark

769
00:28:20.600 --> 00:28:21.160
of light,

770
00:28:21.720 --> 00:28:24.120
each surrounded by its dim veil of

771
00:28:24.120 --> 00:28:26.380
darkness, yet flaming with light that

772
00:28:26.380 --> 00:28:27.600
could never be quenched,

773
00:28:28.240 --> 00:28:30.360
coming and going like fireflies in

774
00:28:30.360 --> 00:28:32.900
springtime, filled they with space,

775
00:28:33.080 --> 00:28:34.620
with light and with life.

776
00:28:36.020 --> 00:28:39.400
I, death, come, and yet I remain

777
00:28:39.400 --> 00:28:42.420
not, for life eternal exists in the all,

778
00:28:42.420 --> 00:28:45.140
only an obstacle I in the pathway,

779
00:28:45.700 --> 00:28:48.000
quick to be conquered by the infinite light.

780
00:28:48.680 --> 00:28:51.480
Awaken, O flame that burns ever inward,

781
00:28:51.880 --> 00:28:54.300
flame forth and conquer the veil of

782
00:28:54.300 --> 00:28:54.720
the night.

783
00:28:55.600 --> 00:28:57.720
Then in the midst of the flames

784
00:28:57.720 --> 00:28:59.540
in the darkness grew there one that

785
00:28:59.540 --> 00:29:00.800
drove forth the night,

786
00:29:01.040 --> 00:29:03.260
flaming, expanding, ever brighter,

787
00:29:03.440 --> 00:29:05.580
until at last was nothing but light.

788
00:29:06.080 --> 00:29:08.640
Then spoke my guide, the voice of

789
00:29:08.640 --> 00:29:09.200
the Master,

790
00:29:09.780 --> 00:29:12.260
See your own soul as it grows

791
00:29:12.260 --> 00:29:14.900
in the light, free now forever from

792
00:29:14.900 --> 00:29:16.160
the Lord of the night.

793
00:29:17.360 --> 00:29:19.520
Forward he led me through many great

794
00:29:19.520 --> 00:29:21.540
spaces filled with the mysteries of

795
00:29:21.540 --> 00:29:22.660
the children of light,

796
00:29:23.300 --> 00:29:25.500
mysteries that man may never yet know

797
00:29:25.500 --> 00:29:27.880
of until he, too, is a son

798
00:29:27.880 --> 00:29:28.480
of the light.

799
00:29:29.280 --> 00:29:31.200
Backward then he led me into the

800
00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:32.720
light of the hall of the light,

801
00:29:33.280 --> 00:29:35.460
knelt I then before the great Masters,

802
00:29:35.860 --> 00:29:37.980
Lords of all from the cycles above,

803
00:29:38.540 --> 00:29:40.760
spoke he then with words of great

804
00:29:40.760 --> 00:29:41.740
power, saying,

805
00:29:42.200 --> 00:29:43.900
Thou hast been made free of the

806
00:29:43.900 --> 00:29:46.800
halls of Amenti, choose thou thy work

807
00:29:46.800 --> 00:29:48.460
among the children of men.

808
00:29:49.560 --> 00:29:52.820
Then spoke I, O great Master, let

809
00:29:52.820 --> 00:29:54.240
me be a teacher of men,

810
00:29:54.540 --> 00:29:56.560
leading them onward and upward until

811
00:29:56.560 --> 00:29:58.920
they, too, are lights among men,

812
00:29:58.920 --> 00:30:01.140
freed from the veil of the night

813
00:30:01.140 --> 00:30:02.220
that surrounds them,

814
00:30:02.680 --> 00:30:04.600
flaming with light that shall shine

815
00:30:04.600 --> 00:30:05.400
among men.

816
00:30:06.240 --> 00:30:08.080
Spoke to me then the voice,

817
00:30:09.060 --> 00:30:11.300
Go as ye will, so be it

818
00:30:11.300 --> 00:30:14.300
decreed. Master are ye of your destiny,

819
00:30:14.500 --> 00:30:16.400
free to take or reject at will.

820
00:30:16.980 --> 00:30:19.560
Take ye the power, take ye the wisdom.

821
00:30:20.280 --> 00:30:22.120
Shine as a light among the children

822
00:30:22.120 --> 00:30:22.720
of men.

823
00:30:23.540 --> 00:30:26.680
Upward then led me the dweller, dwelt

824
00:30:26.680 --> 00:30:28.540
I again among children of men,

825
00:30:28.720 --> 00:30:30.800
teaching and showing some of my wisdom,

826
00:30:31.500 --> 00:30:34.260
son of the light, a fire among men.

827
00:30:34.980 --> 00:30:37.920
Now again I tread the path downward,

828
00:30:38.440 --> 00:30:40.080
seeking the light in the darkness

829
00:30:40.080 --> 00:30:40.700
of night.

830
00:30:41.360 --> 00:30:43.940
Hold ye and keep ye, preserve my

831
00:30:43.940 --> 00:30:46.600
record, guide shall it be to the

832
00:30:46.600 --> 00:30:47.540
children of men.

833
00:30:55.580 --> 00:30:58.280
I, Thoth, the Atlantean, give of my

834
00:30:58.280 --> 00:31:00.520
wisdom, give of my knowledge, give

835
00:31:00.520 --> 00:31:01.320
of my power,

836
00:31:01.740 --> 00:31:03.640
freely I give to the children of

837
00:31:03.640 --> 00:31:06.260
men. Give that they, too, might have

838
00:31:06.260 --> 00:31:07.300
wisdom to shine

839
00:31:07.300 --> 00:31:08.940
through the world from the veil of

840
00:31:08.940 --> 00:31:11.980
the night. Wisdom is power, and power

841
00:31:11.980 --> 00:31:12.700
is wisdom,

842
00:31:13.020 --> 00:31:14.980
one with each other, perfecting the

843
00:31:14.980 --> 00:31:18.000
whole. Be thou not proud, O man,

844
00:31:18.040 --> 00:31:18.800
in thy wisdom.

845
00:31:18.800 --> 00:31:21.280
Discourse with the ignorant as well

846
00:31:21.280 --> 00:31:22.080
as the wise.

847
00:31:22.360 --> 00:31:23.880
If one comes to thee full of

848
00:31:23.880 --> 00:31:26.260
knowledge, listen and heed, for wisdom

849
00:31:26.260 --> 00:31:26.840
is all.

850
00:31:27.560 --> 00:31:29.660
Keep thou not silent when evil is

851
00:31:29.660 --> 00:31:31.540
spoken, for truth like the sunlight

852
00:31:31.540 --> 00:31:32.860
shines above all.

853
00:31:33.480 --> 00:31:36.000
He who oversteppeth the law shall

854
00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:38.320
be punished, for only through law

855
00:31:38.320 --> 00:31:39.840
comes the freedom of men.

856
00:31:40.700 --> 00:31:42.920
Follow thine heart during thy lifetime.

857
00:31:43.560 --> 00:31:45.840
Do thou more than is commanded of thee.

858
00:31:46.340 --> 00:31:48.820
When thou hast gained riches, follow

859
00:31:48.820 --> 00:31:51.480
thou thine heart, for all these are

860
00:31:51.480 --> 00:31:52.260
of no avail

861
00:31:52.260 --> 00:31:55.040
if thine heart be weary. Diminish

862
00:31:55.040 --> 00:31:57.520
thou not the time of following thine heart.

863
00:31:57.980 --> 00:31:59.860
It is abhorred of the soul.

864
00:32:02.300 --> 00:32:04.400
They that are guided go not astray,

865
00:32:04.660 --> 00:32:06.780
but they that are lost cannot find

866
00:32:06.780 --> 00:32:07.640
a straight path.

867
00:32:08.020 --> 00:32:09.940
If thou go among men, make for

868
00:32:09.940 --> 00:32:12.100
thyself love the beginning and end

869
00:32:12.100 --> 00:32:12.700
of the heart.

870
00:32:12.700 --> 00:32:15.220
If one cometh unto thee for counsel,

871
00:32:15.380 --> 00:32:16.380
let him speak freely,

872
00:32:16.820 --> 00:32:18.180
that the thing for which he hath

873
00:32:18.180 --> 00:32:19.540
come to thee may be done.

874
00:32:20.060 --> 00:32:21.960
If he hesitates to open his heart

875
00:32:21.960 --> 00:32:23.780
to thee, it is because thou, the

876
00:32:23.780 --> 00:32:25.220
judge, doeth the wrong.

877
00:32:25.880 --> 00:32:27.960
Repeat thou not extravagant speech,

878
00:32:28.340 --> 00:32:29.880
neither listen thou to it,

879
00:32:30.280 --> 00:32:32.020
for it is the utterance of one

880
00:32:32.020 --> 00:32:34.720
not in equilibrium. Speak thou not

881
00:32:34.720 --> 00:32:35.140
of it,

882
00:32:35.440 --> 00:32:37.080
so that he before thee may know

883
00:32:37.080 --> 00:32:39.720
wisdom. Silence is of great profit.

884
00:32:40.320 --> 00:32:42.880
An abundance of speech profiteth nothing.

885
00:32:43.480 --> 00:32:45.640
Exalt not thine heart above the children

886
00:32:45.640 --> 00:32:46.120
of men,

887
00:32:46.420 --> 00:32:48.560
lest it be brought lower than the dust.

888
00:32:50.860 --> 00:32:53.580
If thou be great among men, be

889
00:32:53.580 --> 00:32:55.520
honored for knowledge and gentleness.

890
00:32:56.160 --> 00:32:58.060
If thou seekest to know the nature

891
00:32:58.060 --> 00:33:00.280
of a friend, ask not his companion,

892
00:33:00.440 --> 00:33:01.960
but pass a time alone with

893
00:33:01.960 --> 00:33:05.300
him. Debate with him, testing his

894
00:33:05.300 --> 00:33:07.180
heart by his words and his bearing.

895
00:33:08.080 --> 00:33:10.580
That which goeth into the storehouse

896
00:33:10.580 --> 00:33:11.620
must come forth,

897
00:33:11.760 --> 00:33:13.300
and the things that are thine must

898
00:33:13.300 --> 00:33:14.540
be shared with a friend.

899
00:33:15.380 --> 00:33:17.260
Knowledge is regarded by the fool

900
00:33:17.260 --> 00:33:19.420
as ignorance, and the things that

901
00:33:19.420 --> 00:33:20.800
are profitable are to him

902
00:33:20.800 --> 00:33:24.300
hurtful. He liveth in death, it is

903
00:33:24.300 --> 00:33:25.500
therefore his food.

904
00:33:25.980 --> 00:33:28.640
The wise man lets his heart overflow,

905
00:33:29.100 --> 00:33:31.140
but keeps silent his mouth.

906
00:33:33.060 --> 00:33:35.840
O man, list to the voice of

907
00:33:35.840 --> 00:33:38.360
wisdom, list to the voice of light.

908
00:33:39.040 --> 00:33:40.920
Mysteries there are in the cosmos

909
00:33:40.920 --> 00:33:43.060
that unveiled filled the world with

910
00:33:43.060 --> 00:33:43.700
their light.

911
00:33:44.440 --> 00:33:46.100
Let he who would be free from

912
00:33:46.100 --> 00:33:48.080
the bonds of darkness first divine

913
00:33:48.080 --> 00:33:49.280
the material from the

914
00:33:49.280 --> 00:33:51.660
immaterial, the fire from the earth.

915
00:33:52.240 --> 00:33:54.440
For know ye that as earth descends

916
00:33:54.440 --> 00:33:54.960
to earth,

917
00:33:55.300 --> 00:33:57.720
so also fire ascends into fire and

918
00:33:57.720 --> 00:33:59.080
becomes one with fire.

919
00:33:59.580 --> 00:34:01.360
He who knows the fire that is

920
00:34:01.360 --> 00:34:03.160
within himself shall ascend until

921
00:34:03.160 --> 00:34:04.200
the eternal fire

922
00:34:04.200 --> 00:34:07.960
and dwell in it eternally. Fire, the

923
00:34:07.960 --> 00:34:08.660
inner fire,

924
00:34:09.060 --> 00:34:11.080
is the most potent of all force

925
00:34:11.080 --> 00:34:14.160
for it overcometh all things and penetrates

926
00:34:14.160 --> 00:34:15.600
to all things of the

927
00:34:15.600 --> 00:34:20.180
earth. Man supports himself only on

928
00:34:20.180 --> 00:34:20.660
that which

929
00:34:20.660 --> 00:34:23.780
resists, so earth must resist man

930
00:34:23.780 --> 00:34:25.400
else he existeth not.

931
00:34:26.120 --> 00:34:28.200
All eyes do not see with the

932
00:34:28.200 --> 00:34:30.740
same vision. For to one an object

933
00:34:30.740 --> 00:34:32.100
appears of one form

934
00:34:32.100 --> 00:34:33.720
and color, and to a different eye

935
00:34:33.720 --> 00:34:36.940
of another. So also the infinite fire,

936
00:34:37.260 --> 00:34:38.200
changing from color

937
00:34:38.200 --> 00:34:40.180
to color, is never the same from

938
00:34:40.180 --> 00:34:43.200
day to day. Thus speak I, Thoth,

939
00:34:43.300 --> 00:34:44.020
of my wisdom.

940
00:34:44.420 --> 00:34:46.660
For man is a fire burning bright

941
00:34:46.660 --> 00:34:48.820
through the night, never is quenched

942
00:34:48.820 --> 00:34:49.740
in the veil of the

943
00:34:49.740 --> 00:34:51.960
darkness, never is quenched by the

944
00:34:51.960 --> 00:34:52.840
veil of the night.

945
00:34:52.840 --> 00:34:55.560
Hark ye, O man, and list to

946
00:34:55.560 --> 00:34:59.220
this wisdom. Where do name and form cease?

947
00:35:00.020 --> 00:35:02.180
Only in consciousness, invisible,

948
00:35:02.680 --> 00:35:04.880
an infinite force of radiance bright.

949
00:35:05.740 --> 00:35:08.220
The forms that ye create by brightening

950
00:35:08.220 --> 00:35:10.440
thy vision are truly effects that

951
00:35:10.440 --> 00:35:11.660
follow thy cause.

952
00:35:13.560 --> 00:35:15.940
Man is a star bound to a

953
00:35:15.940 --> 00:35:18.040
body, until in the end he is

954
00:35:18.040 --> 00:35:19.340
freed through his strife.

955
00:35:19.900 --> 00:35:22.380
Only struggle and toiling thy utmost

956
00:35:22.380 --> 00:35:24.440
shall the star within thee bloom out

957
00:35:24.440 --> 00:35:25.300
in new life.

958
00:35:25.960 --> 00:35:28.020
He who knows the commencement of all

959
00:35:28.020 --> 00:35:30.760
things, free, is his star from the

960
00:35:30.760 --> 00:35:31.660
realms of night.

961
00:35:32.480 --> 00:35:35.220
Remember, O man, that all which exist

962
00:35:35.220 --> 00:35:37.580
is only another form of that which

963
00:35:37.580 --> 00:35:38.440
exists not.

964
00:35:39.220 --> 00:35:41.300
Everything that has being is passing

965
00:35:41.300 --> 00:35:44.200
into yet other being, and thou thyself

966
00:35:44.200 --> 00:35:44.960
are not an

967
00:35:44.960 --> 00:35:48.300
exception. Consider the law, for all

968
00:35:48.300 --> 00:35:48.900
is law.

969
00:35:49.740 --> 00:35:51.460
Seek not that which is not of

970
00:35:51.460 --> 00:35:53.920
the law, for such exist only in

971
00:35:53.920 --> 00:35:55.340
the illusions of the senses.

972
00:35:56.220 --> 00:35:58.780
Wisdom cometh to all her children,

973
00:35:59.060 --> 00:36:01.260
even as they cometh unto wisdom.

974
00:36:01.860 --> 00:36:03.960
All through the ages the light has

975
00:36:03.960 --> 00:36:07.400
been hidden. Awake, O man, and be wise.

976
00:36:09.380 --> 00:36:11.860
Far neath the earth crust, in the

977
00:36:11.860 --> 00:36:14.360
halls of Amenti, mysteries I saw that

978
00:36:14.360 --> 00:36:15.460
are hidden from men.

979
00:36:16.360 --> 00:36:18.100
Oft have I journeyed the deep hidden

980
00:36:18.100 --> 00:36:20.140
passage, looked on the light that

981
00:36:20.140 --> 00:36:21.320
is life among men.

982
00:36:22.040 --> 00:36:24.120
There, neath the flowers of life ever

983
00:36:24.120 --> 00:36:26.420
living, searched I the hearts and

984
00:36:26.420 --> 00:36:27.400
the secrets of men.

985
00:36:28.040 --> 00:36:29.880
Found I that man is but living

986
00:36:29.880 --> 00:36:32.200
in darkness, light of the great fire

987
00:36:32.200 --> 00:36:33.080
is hidden within.

988
00:36:34.160 --> 00:36:36.800
Before the lords of hidden Amenti,

989
00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:39.460
learned I the wisdom I given to men.

990
00:36:40.360 --> 00:36:42.160
Masters are they of the great secret

991
00:36:42.160 --> 00:36:44.440
wisdom, brought from the future of

992
00:36:44.440 --> 00:36:45.460
infinity's end.

993
00:36:46.280 --> 00:36:48.620
Seven are they, the lords of Amenti,

994
00:36:49.120 --> 00:36:50.900
overlords they of the children of

995
00:36:50.900 --> 00:36:52.120
morning, sons of the

996
00:36:52.120 --> 00:36:55.480
cycles, masters of wisdom. Formed

997
00:36:55.480 --> 00:36:57.620
are not they as the children of men.

998
00:36:58.500 --> 00:37:02.040
Three, four, five, and six, seven,

999
00:37:02.160 --> 00:37:04.520
eight, nine are the titles of the

1000
00:37:04.520 --> 00:37:05.440
masters of men.

1001
00:37:06.360 --> 00:37:09.420
Far from the future, formless yet

1002
00:37:09.420 --> 00:37:12.020
forming, came they as teachers for

1003
00:37:12.020 --> 00:37:13.020
the children of men.

1004
00:37:13.920 --> 00:37:16.400
Live they forever, yet not of the

1005
00:37:16.400 --> 00:37:18.960
living, bound not to life, and yet

1006
00:37:18.960 --> 00:37:19.960
free from death.

1007
00:37:20.580 --> 00:37:22.860
Rule they forever with infinite wisdom,

1008
00:37:23.220 --> 00:37:25.020
bound yet not bound to the dark

1009
00:37:25.020 --> 00:37:25.900
halls of death.

1010
00:37:26.700 --> 00:37:29.300
Life they have in them, yet life

1011
00:37:29.300 --> 00:37:31.680
that is not life, free from all

1012
00:37:31.680 --> 00:37:33.340
are the lords of the all.

1013
00:37:35.060 --> 00:37:37.560
Fourth from them came forth the logos,

1014
00:37:38.080 --> 00:37:40.240
instruments they of the power over all.

1015
00:37:40.760 --> 00:37:43.200
Vast is their countenance, yet hidden

1016
00:37:43.200 --> 00:37:45.780
in smallness, formed by a forming,

1017
00:37:46.320 --> 00:37:47.640
known yet unknown.

1018
00:37:48.600 --> 00:37:51.140
Three holds the key of all hidden

1019
00:37:51.140 --> 00:37:53.880
magic, creator he of the halls of

1020
00:37:53.880 --> 00:37:54.400
the dead.

1021
00:37:55.200 --> 00:37:57.640
Sending forth power, shrouding with

1022
00:37:57.640 --> 00:37:59.680
darkness, binding the souls of the

1023
00:37:59.680 --> 00:38:00.460
children of men.

1024
00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:03.000
Sending the darkness, binding the

1025
00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:05.120
soul force, director of negative to

1026
00:38:05.120 --> 00:38:06.100
the children of men.

1027
00:38:07.040 --> 00:38:09.700
Four is he who looses the power,

1028
00:38:10.440 --> 00:38:12.480
lord he of life to the children

1029
00:38:12.480 --> 00:38:13.040
of men.

1030
00:38:13.780 --> 00:38:16.300
Light in his body, flame in his

1031
00:38:16.300 --> 00:38:18.560
countenance, freer of souls to the

1032
00:38:18.560 --> 00:38:19.380
children of men.

1033
00:38:20.200 --> 00:38:23.140
Five is the master, the lord of

1034
00:38:23.140 --> 00:38:25.780
all magic, key to the word that

1035
00:38:25.780 --> 00:38:27.460
resounds among men.

1036
00:38:28.140 --> 00:38:30.520
Six is the lord of light, the

1037
00:38:30.520 --> 00:38:32.700
hidden pathway, part of the souls

1038
00:38:32.700 --> 00:38:33.880
of the children of men.

1039
00:38:34.760 --> 00:38:36.980
Seven is he who is lord of

1040
00:38:36.980 --> 00:38:39.040
the vastness, master of space and

1041
00:38:39.040 --> 00:38:40.280
the key of the times.

1042
00:38:41.120 --> 00:38:43.680
Eight is he who orders the progress,

1043
00:38:44.020 --> 00:38:46.280
weighs and balances the journey of men.

1044
00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:50.020
Nine is the father, vast he of

1045
00:38:50.020 --> 00:38:51.980
countenance, forming and changing

1046
00:38:51.980 --> 00:38:53.740
from out of the formless.

1047
00:38:55.380 --> 00:38:57.800
Meditate on the symbols I give thee,

1048
00:38:58.380 --> 00:39:01.100
keys are they, though hidden from men.

1049
00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:04.560
Reach ever upward, O soul of the

1050
00:39:04.560 --> 00:39:06.900
morning, turn thy thoughts upward

1051
00:39:06.900 --> 00:39:08.360
to light and to life.

1052
00:39:08.620 --> 00:39:10.640
Find in the keys of the numbers

1053
00:39:10.640 --> 00:39:12.800
I bring thee, light on the pathway

1054
00:39:12.800 --> 00:39:14.280
from life until life.

1055
00:39:14.860 --> 00:39:18.080
Seek ye with wisdom, turn thy thoughts

1056
00:39:18.080 --> 00:39:20.840
inward, close not thy mind to the

1057
00:39:20.840 --> 00:39:21.820
flower of light.

1058
00:39:22.620 --> 00:39:24.720
Place in thy body a thought-formed

1059
00:39:24.720 --> 00:39:26.860
picture, think of the numbers that

1060
00:39:26.860 --> 00:39:28.080
lead thee to life.

1061
00:39:29.060 --> 00:39:31.020
Clear is the pathway to he who

1062
00:39:31.020 --> 00:39:33.700
has wisdom, open the door to the

1063
00:39:33.700 --> 00:39:34.620
kingdom of light.

1064
00:39:35.500 --> 00:39:37.760
Pour forth thy flame as a sun

1065
00:39:37.760 --> 00:39:40.000
of the morning, shut out the darkness

1066
00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:41.560
and live in the day.

1067
00:39:42.280 --> 00:39:44.140
Take thee, O man, as part of

1068
00:39:44.140 --> 00:39:46.380
thy being, the seven who are but

1069
00:39:46.380 --> 00:39:47.860
are not as they seem.

1070
00:39:48.620 --> 00:39:50.660
Open, O man, have I my wisdom,

1071
00:39:50.960 --> 00:39:52.860
follow the path in the way I

1072
00:39:52.860 --> 00:39:53.520
have led.

1073
00:39:54.220 --> 00:39:56.820
Masters of wisdom, sun of the morning,

1074
00:39:57.480 --> 00:39:59.900
light and life to the children of men.

1075
00:40:06.840 --> 00:40:07.360
Thoth

1076
00:40:07.360 --> 00:40:08.840
List ye, O man, to the voice

1077
00:40:08.840 --> 00:40:11.080
of wisdom, list to the voice of

1078
00:40:11.080 --> 00:40:12.360
Thoth the Atlantean.

1079
00:40:12.860 --> 00:40:14.460
Freely I give to thee of my

1080
00:40:14.460 --> 00:40:16.360
wisdom, gathered from the time and

1081
00:40:16.360 --> 00:40:17.520
space of this cycle,

1082
00:40:17.920 --> 00:40:20.380
master of mysteries, sun of the morning,

1083
00:40:20.600 --> 00:40:23.120
living forever, a child of the light,

1084
00:40:23.540 --> 00:40:25.640
shining with brightness, star of the

1085
00:40:25.640 --> 00:40:27.920
morning, Thoth the teacher of men

1086
00:40:27.920 --> 00:40:28.660
is of all.

1087
00:40:29.220 --> 00:40:31.880
Long time ago I in my childhood

1088
00:40:31.880 --> 00:40:34.620
lay neath the stars on long buried Atlantis,

1089
00:40:35.080 --> 00:40:37.200
dreaming of mysteries far above men.

1090
00:40:37.840 --> 00:40:39.480
Then in my heart grew there a

1091
00:40:39.480 --> 00:40:41.320
great longing to conquer the pathway

1092
00:40:41.320 --> 00:40:42.640
that led to the stars.

1093
00:40:43.120 --> 00:40:45.180
Year after year I sought after wisdom,

1094
00:40:45.660 --> 00:40:47.860
seeking new knowledge, following the way,

1095
00:40:48.220 --> 00:40:50.580
until at last my soul, in great

1096
00:40:50.580 --> 00:40:52.640
travail, broke from its bondage and

1097
00:40:52.640 --> 00:40:53.380
bounded away.

1098
00:40:53.380 --> 00:40:55.620
Free was I from the bondage of

1099
00:40:55.620 --> 00:40:57.840
earth men, free from the body I

1100
00:40:57.840 --> 00:40:59.160
flashed through the night.

1101
00:40:59.700 --> 00:41:01.620
Unlocked at last for me was the

1102
00:41:01.620 --> 00:41:04.060
star space, free was I from the

1103
00:41:04.060 --> 00:41:04.920
bondage of night.

1104
00:41:05.400 --> 00:41:07.080
Now to the end of space sought

1105
00:41:07.080 --> 00:41:09.260
I wisdom, far beyond knowledge of

1106
00:41:09.260 --> 00:41:10.180
finite man.

1107
00:41:11.620 --> 00:41:14.440
Far into space my soul travelled freely

1108
00:41:14.440 --> 00:41:16.640
into infinity's circle of light.

1109
00:41:17.200 --> 00:41:19.040
Strange beyond knowledge were some

1110
00:41:19.040 --> 00:41:21.000
of the planets, great and gigantic

1111
00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:22.460
beyond dreams of men,

1112
00:41:22.460 --> 00:41:24.800
yet found I Law in all of

1113
00:41:24.800 --> 00:41:26.640
its beauty, working through and among

1114
00:41:26.640 --> 00:41:28.200
them as here among men.

1115
00:41:28.780 --> 00:41:31.060
Flashed forth my soul through infinity's

1116
00:41:31.060 --> 00:41:33.560
beauty, far through space I flew with

1117
00:41:33.560 --> 00:41:34.220
my thoughts.

1118
00:41:35.020 --> 00:41:36.520
Rested I there on a planet of

1119
00:41:36.520 --> 00:41:38.820
beauty, strains of harmony filled

1120
00:41:38.820 --> 00:41:39.720
all the air.

1121
00:41:40.400 --> 00:41:42.280
Shapes there were moving, in order

1122
00:41:42.280 --> 00:41:44.500
great and majestic as stars in the night,

1123
00:41:44.680 --> 00:41:47.000
mounting in harmony, order equilibrium,

1124
00:41:47.460 --> 00:41:49.940
symbols of the cosmic, like unto Law.

1125
00:41:50.580 --> 00:41:52.460
Many the stars I passed in my

1126
00:41:52.460 --> 00:41:54.740
journey, many the races of men on

1127
00:41:54.740 --> 00:41:55.400
their worlds,

1128
00:41:55.700 --> 00:41:57.380
some reaching high as stars of the

1129
00:41:57.380 --> 00:41:59.800
morning, some falling low in the blackness

1130
00:41:59.800 --> 00:42:00.340
of night,

1131
00:42:00.740 --> 00:42:02.780
each and all of them struggling upward,

1132
00:42:03.220 --> 00:42:05.100
gaining the heights and plumbing the depths,

1133
00:42:05.300 --> 00:42:07.400
moving at times in realms of brightness,

1134
00:42:07.900 --> 00:42:10.060
living through darkness, gaining the light.

1135
00:42:11.940 --> 00:42:13.820
Know, O man, that light is thine

1136
00:42:13.820 --> 00:42:16.060
heritage, know that darkness is only

1137
00:42:16.060 --> 00:42:16.620
a veil,

1138
00:42:16.620 --> 00:42:18.700
sealed in thine heart is brightness

1139
00:42:18.700 --> 00:42:20.940
eternal, waiting the moment of freedom

1140
00:42:20.940 --> 00:42:21.600
to conquer,

1141
00:42:22.160 --> 00:42:23.660
waiting to rend the veil of the

1142
00:42:23.660 --> 00:42:26.360
night. Some I found who had conquered

1143
00:42:26.360 --> 00:42:26.900
the ether,

1144
00:42:27.300 --> 00:42:29.080
free of space were they while yet

1145
00:42:29.080 --> 00:42:31.480
they were men. Using the force that

1146
00:42:31.480 --> 00:42:32.700
is the foundation of all

1147
00:42:32.700 --> 00:42:35.280
things, far in space constructed they

1148
00:42:35.280 --> 00:42:37.640
a planet, drawn by the force that

1149
00:42:37.640 --> 00:42:38.840
flows through the all,

1150
00:42:39.300 --> 00:42:41.880
condensing, coalescing the ether into

1151
00:42:41.880 --> 00:42:44.160
forms that grew as they willed,

1152
00:42:44.160 --> 00:42:46.740
outstripping in science, they, all

1153
00:42:46.740 --> 00:42:49.280
of the races, mighty in wisdom, sons

1154
00:42:49.280 --> 00:42:50.240
of the stars.

1155
00:42:51.340 --> 00:42:53.440
Long time I paused watching their

1156
00:42:53.440 --> 00:42:55.660
wisdom, saw them create from out of

1157
00:42:55.660 --> 00:42:56.540
the ether cities,

1158
00:42:56.740 --> 00:42:58.960
gigantic of rose and gold, formed

1159
00:42:58.960 --> 00:43:01.240
forth from the primal element, base

1160
00:43:01.240 --> 00:43:02.020
of all matter,

1161
00:43:02.420 --> 00:43:04.960
the ether far flung. Far in the

1162
00:43:04.960 --> 00:43:06.680
past they had conquered the ether,

1163
00:43:06.940 --> 00:43:08.060
freed themselves from the

1164
00:43:08.060 --> 00:43:10.540
bondage of toil, formed in their mind

1165
00:43:10.540 --> 00:43:12.540
only a picture and swiftly created

1166
00:43:12.540 --> 00:43:13.280
it grew.

1167
00:43:13.920 --> 00:43:16.120
Forth then my soul sped throughout

1168
00:43:16.120 --> 00:43:18.860
the cosmos, seeing ever new things

1169
00:43:18.860 --> 00:43:19.400
and old,

1170
00:43:19.720 --> 00:43:21.880
learning that man is truly space born,

1171
00:43:22.420 --> 00:43:24.880
a son of the sun, a child

1172
00:43:24.880 --> 00:43:25.680
of the stars.

1173
00:43:26.800 --> 00:43:29.140
Know ye, O man, whatever from ye

1174
00:43:29.140 --> 00:43:31.780
inhabit, surely it is one with the stars.

1175
00:43:32.520 --> 00:43:34.260
Thy bodies are nothing but planets

1176
00:43:34.260 --> 00:43:36.500
revolving around their central suns.

1177
00:43:36.740 --> 00:43:38.320
When ye have gained the light of

1178
00:43:38.320 --> 00:43:40.540
all wisdom, free shall ye be to

1179
00:43:40.540 --> 00:43:41.560
shine in the ether.

1180
00:43:41.560 --> 00:43:43.840
One of the suns that light outer

1181
00:43:43.840 --> 00:43:46.180
darkness, one of the space born grown

1182
00:43:46.180 --> 00:43:46.920
into light.

1183
00:43:47.380 --> 00:43:49.760
Just as the stars in time lose

1184
00:43:49.760 --> 00:43:51.820
their brilliance, light passing from

1185
00:43:51.820 --> 00:43:53.460
them into the great source,

1186
00:43:53.640 --> 00:43:56.340
so, O man, the soul passes onward,

1187
00:43:56.420 --> 00:43:58.280
leaving behind the darkness of night.

1188
00:43:59.140 --> 00:44:01.620
Forth from ye, from the primal ether,

1189
00:44:01.800 --> 00:44:03.480
filled with the brilliance that flows

1190
00:44:03.480 --> 00:44:04.320
from the source,

1191
00:44:04.840 --> 00:44:07.080
bound by the ether, coalesced around,

1192
00:44:07.460 --> 00:44:09.660
yet ever it flames until at last

1193
00:44:09.660 --> 00:44:10.340
it is free.

1194
00:44:10.900 --> 00:44:12.460
Lift up your flame from out of

1195
00:44:12.460 --> 00:44:14.640
the darkness, fly from the night,

1196
00:44:14.820 --> 00:44:15.980
and ye shall be free.

1197
00:44:16.760 --> 00:44:18.640
Travelled I through the space time,

1198
00:44:19.140 --> 00:44:21.240
knowing my soul at last was set free,

1199
00:44:21.640 --> 00:44:23.740
knowing that now I might pursue wisdom.

1200
00:44:24.280 --> 00:44:25.860
Until at last I passed to a

1201
00:44:25.860 --> 00:44:27.240
plane hidden from knowledge,

1202
00:44:27.440 --> 00:44:29.700
known not to wisdom, extension beyond

1203
00:44:29.700 --> 00:44:30.780
all that we know.

1204
00:44:31.300 --> 00:44:33.020
Now, O man, when I had this

1205
00:44:33.020 --> 00:44:35.900
knowing, happy my soul grew, for now

1206
00:44:35.900 --> 00:44:36.700
I was free.

1207
00:44:37.340 --> 00:44:40.540
Listen, ye space born, list to my

1208
00:44:40.540 --> 00:44:43.220
wisdom, know ye not that ye too

1209
00:44:43.220 --> 00:44:44.240
will be free.

1210
00:44:45.640 --> 00:44:47.620
List ye again, O man, to my

1211
00:44:47.620 --> 00:44:49.660
wisdom, that hearing ye too might

1212
00:44:49.660 --> 00:44:50.560
live and be free.

1213
00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:52.960
Not of the earth are ye, earthy,

1214
00:44:53.140 --> 00:44:55.300
but child of infinite cosmic light.

1215
00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:57.380
Know ye not, O man, of your

1216
00:44:57.380 --> 00:44:59.680
heritage? Know ye not ye are truly

1217
00:44:59.680 --> 00:45:00.260
the light?

1218
00:45:00.740 --> 00:45:02.260
Son of the great sun, when ye

1219
00:45:02.260 --> 00:45:04.780
gain wisdom, truly aware of your kinship

1220
00:45:04.780 --> 00:45:05.320
with light.

1221
00:45:05.880 --> 00:45:08.600
Now, to ye I give knowledge, freedom

1222
00:45:08.600 --> 00:45:10.600
to walk in the path I have trod,

1223
00:45:11.080 --> 00:45:13.200
showing ye truly how by my striving

1224
00:45:13.200 --> 00:45:15.100
I trod the path that leads to

1225
00:45:15.100 --> 00:45:15.660
the stars.

1226
00:45:16.660 --> 00:45:18.260
Hark ye, O man, and know of

1227
00:45:18.260 --> 00:45:20.640
thy bondage, know how to free thyself

1228
00:45:20.640 --> 00:45:21.520
from the toils.

1229
00:45:22.080 --> 00:45:23.820
Out of the darkness shall ye rise

1230
00:45:23.820 --> 00:45:26.000
upward, one with the light, and one

1231
00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:26.780
with the stars.

1232
00:45:27.480 --> 00:45:29.280
Follow ye ever the path of wisdom,

1233
00:45:29.780 --> 00:45:31.900
only by this can ye rise from below.

1234
00:45:31.900 --> 00:45:34.500
Ever man's destiny leads him onward

1235
00:45:34.500 --> 00:45:36.800
into the curves of infinity's all.

1236
00:45:37.440 --> 00:45:39.640
Know ye, O man, that all space

1237
00:45:39.640 --> 00:45:42.020
is ordered, only by order are ye

1238
00:45:42.020 --> 00:45:42.920
one with the all.

1239
00:45:43.340 --> 00:45:45.040
Order and balance are the law of

1240
00:45:45.040 --> 00:45:47.180
the cosmos, follow and ye shall be

1241
00:45:47.180 --> 00:45:48.020
one with the all.

1242
00:45:48.720 --> 00:45:50.680
He who would follow the pathway of

1243
00:45:50.680 --> 00:45:52.520
wisdom, open must be he to the

1244
00:45:52.520 --> 00:45:53.340
flower of life,

1245
00:45:53.700 --> 00:45:55.420
extending his consciousness out of

1246
00:45:55.420 --> 00:45:57.280
the darkness, flowing through time

1247
00:45:57.280 --> 00:45:58.500
and space in the all.

1248
00:45:58.500 --> 00:46:00.820
Deep in the silence first ye must

1249
00:46:00.820 --> 00:46:02.500
linger until at last ye are free

1250
00:46:02.500 --> 00:46:03.220
from desire,

1251
00:46:03.600 --> 00:46:05.240
free from the longing to speak in

1252
00:46:05.240 --> 00:46:07.840
the silence. Conquer by silence the

1253
00:46:07.840 --> 00:46:08.840
bondage of words,

1254
00:46:09.220 --> 00:46:11.140
abstaining from eating until we have

1255
00:46:11.140 --> 00:46:13.380
conquered desire for food, that is

1256
00:46:13.380 --> 00:46:14.380
bondage of soul.

1257
00:46:14.820 --> 00:46:16.360
Then lie ye down in the darkness,

1258
00:46:16.940 --> 00:46:18.880
close ye your eyes from the rays

1259
00:46:18.880 --> 00:46:19.600
of the light.

1260
00:46:20.760 --> 00:46:22.540
Center thy soul in the place of

1261
00:46:22.540 --> 00:46:24.340
thine consciousness, shaking it free

1262
00:46:24.340 --> 00:46:25.680
from the bonds of the night.

1263
00:46:25.680 --> 00:46:28.260
Place in thy mind, place the image

1264
00:46:28.260 --> 00:46:30.800
thou desired. Picture the place thou

1265
00:46:30.800 --> 00:46:32.040
desirest to see.

1266
00:46:32.560 --> 00:46:34.600
Vibrate back and forth with thy power.

1267
00:46:35.160 --> 00:46:37.160
Loosen the soul from out of its night.

1268
00:46:37.720 --> 00:46:39.480
Fiercely must thou shake with all

1269
00:46:39.480 --> 00:46:41.820
of thy power, until at last thy

1270
00:46:41.820 --> 00:46:43.040
soul shall be free.

1271
00:46:43.720 --> 00:46:45.760
Mighty beyond words is the flame of

1272
00:46:45.760 --> 00:46:48.260
the cosmic, hanging in planes unknown

1273
00:46:48.260 --> 00:46:48.880
to man,

1274
00:46:49.300 --> 00:46:51.580
mighty and balanced, moving in order,

1275
00:46:51.980 --> 00:46:54.220
music of harmonies, far beyond man.

1276
00:46:54.220 --> 00:46:56.480
Speaking with music, singing with

1277
00:46:56.480 --> 00:46:58.640
color, flame from the beginning of

1278
00:46:58.640 --> 00:46:59.720
eternity's all.

1279
00:47:00.200 --> 00:47:02.060
Spark of the flame art thou, O

1280
00:47:02.060 --> 00:47:03.900
my children, burning with color and

1281
00:47:03.900 --> 00:47:04.960
living with music.

1282
00:47:05.380 --> 00:47:07.500
List to the voice, and thou shalt

1283
00:47:07.500 --> 00:47:08.200
be free.

1284
00:47:09.820 --> 00:47:11.920
Consciousness free is fused with the

1285
00:47:11.920 --> 00:47:14.200
cosmic, one with the order and law

1286
00:47:14.200 --> 00:47:14.920
of the all.

1287
00:47:15.680 --> 00:47:17.200
Knew ye not, man, that out of

1288
00:47:17.200 --> 00:47:19.220
darkness light shall flame forth,

1289
00:47:19.380 --> 00:47:20.540
a symbol of all?

1290
00:47:21.180 --> 00:47:23.000
Pray ye this prayer for attaining

1291
00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:25.380
of wisdom. Pray for the coming of

1292
00:47:25.380 --> 00:47:26.420
light to the all.

1293
00:47:26.900 --> 00:47:29.120
Mighty spirit of light that shines

1294
00:47:29.120 --> 00:47:30.920
through the cosmos, draw my flame

1295
00:47:30.920 --> 00:47:32.480
closer in harmony to thee.

1296
00:47:33.040 --> 00:47:34.660
Lift up my fire from out of

1297
00:47:34.660 --> 00:47:36.720
the darkness, magnet of fire that

1298
00:47:36.720 --> 00:47:37.820
is one with the all.

1299
00:47:38.400 --> 00:47:40.600
Lift up my soul, thou mighty and

1300
00:47:40.600 --> 00:47:43.320
potent, child of the light, turn not away.

1301
00:47:43.780 --> 00:47:45.500
Draw me in power to melt in

1302
00:47:45.500 --> 00:47:48.240
thy furnace, one with all things and

1303
00:47:48.240 --> 00:47:49.560
all things in one,

1304
00:47:49.560 --> 00:47:51.960
buyer of the life-strain and one

1305
00:47:51.960 --> 00:47:52.780
with the brain.

1306
00:47:53.740 --> 00:47:55.980
When ye have freed thy soul from

1307
00:47:55.980 --> 00:47:58.180
its bondage, know that for ye the

1308
00:47:58.180 --> 00:47:59.220
darkness is gone.

1309
00:47:59.940 --> 00:48:01.920
Ever through space ye may seek wisdom,

1310
00:48:02.360 --> 00:48:04.420
bound not by the fetters forged in

1311
00:48:04.420 --> 00:48:04.960
the flesh.

1312
00:48:05.620 --> 00:48:07.400
Onward and upward into the morning,

1313
00:48:07.880 --> 00:48:09.720
free-flash, O soul, to the realms

1314
00:48:09.720 --> 00:48:10.280
of light.

1315
00:48:10.880 --> 00:48:13.200
Move thou in order, move thou in

1316
00:48:13.200 --> 00:48:15.660
harmony, freely shalt move with the

1317
00:48:15.660 --> 00:48:16.540
children of light.

1318
00:48:17.180 --> 00:48:19.160
Seek ye and know ye my key

1319
00:48:19.160 --> 00:48:22.340
of wisdom, thus, O man, ye shall

1320
00:48:22.340 --> 00:48:23.360
surely be free.

1321
00:48:30.300 --> 00:48:33.400
Oft dream I of buried Atlantis, lost

1322
00:48:33.400 --> 00:48:35.620
in the ages that have passed into night.

1323
00:48:35.920 --> 00:48:38.340
Eon on eon thou existed in beauty,

1324
00:48:38.500 --> 00:48:40.220
a light shining through the darkness

1325
00:48:40.220 --> 00:48:40.860
of night.

1326
00:48:40.860 --> 00:48:43.300
Mighty in power, ruling the earth

1327
00:48:43.300 --> 00:48:46.320
-born, lord of the earth in Atlantis day,

1328
00:48:46.760 --> 00:48:48.920
king of the nations, master of wisdom,

1329
00:48:49.360 --> 00:48:51.420
light through sun-tall, keeper of

1330
00:48:51.420 --> 00:48:51.840
the way,

1331
00:48:52.200 --> 00:48:54.800
dwelt his temple, the master of Unal,

1332
00:48:55.180 --> 00:48:57.580
light of the earth in Atlantis day.

1333
00:48:58.100 --> 00:49:00.340
Master he from a cycle beyond us,

1334
00:49:00.480 --> 00:49:02.500
living in bodies as one among men,

1335
00:49:02.920 --> 00:49:04.980
not as the earth-born, he from

1336
00:49:04.980 --> 00:49:07.520
beyond us, son of a cycle, advance

1337
00:49:07.520 --> 00:49:08.360
beyond men.

1338
00:49:08.360 --> 00:49:11.060
Know ye, O man, that Horlick, the

1339
00:49:11.060 --> 00:49:13.320
master, was never one with the children

1340
00:49:13.320 --> 00:49:13.880
of men.

1341
00:49:14.420 --> 00:49:16.420
Far in the past time, when Atlantis

1342
00:49:16.420 --> 00:49:17.760
first grew as a power,

1343
00:49:18.080 --> 00:49:19.740
appeared there one with the key of

1344
00:49:19.740 --> 00:49:22.420
wisdom, showing the way of light to all.

1345
00:49:22.820 --> 00:49:24.560
Showed he to all men the path

1346
00:49:24.560 --> 00:49:26.580
of attainment, way of the light that

1347
00:49:26.580 --> 00:49:27.580
flows among men,

1348
00:49:27.940 --> 00:49:29.980
mastering darkness, leading the man

1349
00:49:29.980 --> 00:49:31.840
-soul upward to heights that were

1350
00:49:31.840 --> 00:49:33.020
one with the light.

1351
00:49:34.760 --> 00:49:37.220
Divided the kingdoms he into sections,

1352
00:49:37.660 --> 00:49:39.740
ten were they, ruled by children of men.

1353
00:49:40.240 --> 00:49:42.900
Upon another built he a temple, built,

1354
00:49:43.200 --> 00:49:44.760
but not by the children of men.

1355
00:49:45.400 --> 00:49:47.040
Out of the ether called he its

1356
00:49:47.040 --> 00:49:49.560
substance, molded and formed by the

1357
00:49:49.560 --> 00:49:50.520
power of Tolan

1358
00:49:50.520 --> 00:49:52.080
into the forms he built with his

1359
00:49:52.080 --> 00:49:55.280
mind. Mile upon mile it covered the island,

1360
00:49:55.880 --> 00:49:57.880
space upon space it grew in its

1361
00:49:57.880 --> 00:50:01.440
might. Black, yet not black, but dark

1362
00:50:01.440 --> 00:50:02.500
like space-time,

1363
00:50:02.500 --> 00:50:04.520
deep in its heart the essence of

1364
00:50:04.520 --> 00:50:07.580
light. Swiftly the temple grew into being,

1365
00:50:07.880 --> 00:50:09.520
molded and shaped by the word of

1366
00:50:09.520 --> 00:50:11.740
the dweller, called from the formless

1367
00:50:11.740 --> 00:50:12.640
into form.

1368
00:50:13.220 --> 00:50:15.420
Builded he then, within it, great

1369
00:50:15.420 --> 00:50:17.780
chambers, filled them with forms called

1370
00:50:17.780 --> 00:50:18.920
forth from the ether,

1371
00:50:19.440 --> 00:50:21.280
filled them with wisdom called forth

1372
00:50:21.280 --> 00:50:24.040
by his mind. Formless was he within

1373
00:50:24.040 --> 00:50:24.580
the temple,

1374
00:50:25.020 --> 00:50:26.860
yet was he formed in the image

1375
00:50:26.860 --> 00:50:29.440
of men. Dwelling among them, yet not

1376
00:50:29.440 --> 00:50:29.900
of them,

1377
00:50:29.900 --> 00:50:32.320
strange and far different was he from

1378
00:50:32.320 --> 00:50:33.360
the children of men.

1379
00:50:34.240 --> 00:50:36.420
Choose he then from among the people,

1380
00:50:36.620 --> 00:50:38.040
three who became his gateway.

1381
00:50:38.740 --> 00:50:40.360
Choose he the three from the highest

1382
00:50:40.360 --> 00:50:42.180
to become his links with Atlantis,

1383
00:50:42.760 --> 00:50:44.860
messengers they who carried his counsel

1384
00:50:44.860 --> 00:50:46.940
to the kings of the children of men.

1385
00:50:47.600 --> 00:50:49.300
Brought he forth others and taught

1386
00:50:49.300 --> 00:50:51.460
them wisdom, teachers they to the

1387
00:50:51.460 --> 00:50:52.260
children of men.

1388
00:50:52.840 --> 00:50:54.300
Placed he them on the island of

1389
00:50:54.300 --> 00:50:56.400
Undal to stand as teachers of light

1390
00:50:56.400 --> 00:50:56.900
to men.

1391
00:50:57.460 --> 00:50:59.360
Each of those who were thus chosen,

1392
00:50:59.900 --> 00:51:01.560
taught must he be for years five

1393
00:51:01.560 --> 00:51:02.120
and ten.

1394
00:51:02.680 --> 00:51:04.400
Only thus could he have understanding

1395
00:51:04.400 --> 00:51:06.340
to bring light to the children of men.

1396
00:51:06.880 --> 00:51:09.040
Thus there came into being the temple,

1397
00:51:09.420 --> 00:51:11.820
a dwelling-place for the master of men.

1398
00:51:12.820 --> 00:51:15.460
I, Thoth, have ever sought wisdom,

1399
00:51:15.680 --> 00:51:17.180
searching in darkness and searching

1400
00:51:17.180 --> 00:51:17.780
in light.

1401
00:51:18.400 --> 00:51:20.020
Long in my youth I travelled the

1402
00:51:20.020 --> 00:51:22.320
pathway, seeking ever new knowledge

1403
00:51:22.320 --> 00:51:22.840
to gain,

1404
00:51:22.840 --> 00:51:25.220
until after much striving one of the

1405
00:51:25.220 --> 00:51:26.800
three to me brought the light.

1406
00:51:27.340 --> 00:51:29.340
Brought he to me the commands of

1407
00:51:29.340 --> 00:51:31.580
the dweller, called me from the darkness

1408
00:51:31.580 --> 00:51:32.560
into the light.

1409
00:51:33.120 --> 00:51:35.040
Brought he me before the dweller,

1410
00:51:35.360 --> 00:51:37.580
deep in the temple before the great fire.

1411
00:51:38.560 --> 00:51:40.480
There on the great throne beheld I,

1412
00:51:40.600 --> 00:51:42.200
the dweller, clothed with the light

1413
00:51:42.200 --> 00:51:43.420
and flashing with fire.

1414
00:51:44.020 --> 00:51:45.920
Down I knelt before that great wisdom,

1415
00:51:46.060 --> 00:51:47.360
filling the light flowing through

1416
00:51:47.360 --> 00:51:48.280
me in waves.

1417
00:51:48.280 --> 00:51:50.600
Heard I then the voice of the dweller,

1418
00:51:51.460 --> 00:51:53.840
O darkness, come into the light, long

1419
00:51:53.840 --> 00:51:55.800
have ye sought the pathway to light.

1420
00:51:56.300 --> 00:51:58.660
Each soul on earth that loosens its

1421
00:51:58.660 --> 00:52:01.380
fetters shall soon be made free from

1422
00:52:01.380 --> 00:52:02.440
the bondage of night.

1423
00:52:03.100 --> 00:52:05.200
Forth from the darkness have ye arisen,

1424
00:52:05.660 --> 00:52:07.580
closer approach the light of your goal.

1425
00:52:08.160 --> 00:52:09.700
Here ye shall dwell as one of

1426
00:52:09.700 --> 00:52:11.640
my children, keeper of records gathered

1427
00:52:11.640 --> 00:52:12.300
by wisdom,

1428
00:52:12.800 --> 00:52:14.840
instrument thou of the light from beyond.

1429
00:52:15.540 --> 00:52:17.380
Ready by thou made to do what

1430
00:52:17.380 --> 00:52:19.700
is needed, preserver of wisdom through

1431
00:52:19.700 --> 00:52:20.700
the ages of darkness.

1432
00:52:21.380 --> 00:52:23.160
That shall come fast on the children

1433
00:52:23.160 --> 00:52:25.740
of men, live thee here and drink

1434
00:52:25.740 --> 00:52:26.520
of all wisdom,

1435
00:52:27.080 --> 00:52:30.080
secrets and mysteries unto thee shall unveil.

1436
00:52:30.740 --> 00:52:32.620
Then I answered the master of cycles,

1437
00:52:32.780 --> 00:52:35.420
saying, O light that descended to men,

1438
00:52:35.900 --> 00:52:37.520
give thou to me of thy wisdom

1439
00:52:37.520 --> 00:52:39.320
that I might be a teacher of men.

1440
00:52:39.760 --> 00:52:42.040
Give thou of thy light that I

1441
00:52:42.040 --> 00:52:42.780
may be free.

1442
00:52:43.900 --> 00:52:46.300
Spoke then to me again the master,

1443
00:52:47.300 --> 00:52:49.160
age after age shall ye live through

1444
00:52:49.160 --> 00:52:49.800
your wisdom.

1445
00:52:50.640 --> 00:52:53.420
I, when over Atlantis the ocean waves

1446
00:52:53.420 --> 00:52:56.180
roll, holding the light, though hidden

1447
00:52:56.180 --> 00:52:56.820
in darkness,

1448
00:52:57.060 --> 00:52:59.400
ready to come when over thou shalt call.

1449
00:53:00.420 --> 00:53:02.340
Go thee now and learn greater wisdom,

1450
00:53:03.060 --> 00:53:05.760
grow thou through light to infinities all.

1451
00:53:06.640 --> 00:53:08.520
Long then dwelt I in the temple

1452
00:53:08.520 --> 00:53:10.740
of the dweller until at last I

1453
00:53:10.740 --> 00:53:12.760
was one with the light.

1454
00:53:13.420 --> 00:53:15.720
Light there was in ancient Atlantis,

1455
00:53:16.120 --> 00:53:18.600
yet darkness too was hidden in all.

1456
00:53:19.220 --> 00:53:21.140
Fell from the light into the darkness

1457
00:53:21.140 --> 00:53:23.820
some who had risen to heights among men.

1458
00:53:24.460 --> 00:53:26.280
Proud they became because of their

1459
00:53:26.280 --> 00:53:28.580
knowledge, proud were they of their

1460
00:53:28.580 --> 00:53:29.620
place among men.

1461
00:53:30.560 --> 00:53:32.600
Deep delved they into the forbidden,

1462
00:53:33.360 --> 00:53:35.340
opened the gateway that led to below.

1463
00:53:36.160 --> 00:53:38.080
Sought they to gain ever more knowledge,

1464
00:53:38.220 --> 00:53:40.080
but seeking to bring it up from below.

1465
00:53:40.900 --> 00:53:43.680
He who descends below must have balance,

1466
00:53:44.220 --> 00:53:45.900
else he is bound by lack of

1467
00:53:45.900 --> 00:53:46.480
our light.

1468
00:53:47.320 --> 00:53:49.380
Opened they then by their knowledge

1469
00:53:49.380 --> 00:53:51.280
pathways forbidden to man.

1470
00:53:52.020 --> 00:53:54.260
But in his temple all seeing the

1471
00:53:54.260 --> 00:53:55.740
dweller lay in his iguante,

1472
00:53:56.480 --> 00:53:58.720
while through Atlantis his soul roamed free.

1473
00:53:59.680 --> 00:54:01.960
Saw he the Atlanteans by their magic

1474
00:54:01.960 --> 00:54:03.660
opening the gateway that would bring

1475
00:54:03.660 --> 00:54:05.120
to earth a great woe.

1476
00:54:05.640 --> 00:54:07.400
Fast fled his soul then back to

1477
00:54:07.400 --> 00:54:07.920
his body.

1478
00:54:07.920 --> 00:54:10.420
Up he arose from his iguante.

1479
00:54:10.940 --> 00:54:12.920
Called he the three mighty messengers.

1480
00:54:13.580 --> 00:54:15.880
Gave the commands that shattered the world.

1481
00:54:16.780 --> 00:54:18.580
Deep neath earth's crust to the halls

1482
00:54:18.580 --> 00:54:20.700
of Amenti swiftly descended the dweller.

1483
00:54:21.460 --> 00:54:23.160
Called he then on the powers of

1484
00:54:23.160 --> 00:54:24.660
the seven lords wielded.

1485
00:54:25.260 --> 00:54:26.840
Changed the earth's balance.

1486
00:54:27.400 --> 00:54:30.440
Down sank Atlantis beneath the dark waves.

1487
00:54:31.300 --> 00:54:33.600
Shattered the gateway that had been opened.

1488
00:54:34.100 --> 00:54:36.200
Shattered the doorway that led down below.

1489
00:54:36.760 --> 00:54:38.320
All of the islands were shattered

1490
00:54:38.320 --> 00:54:39.200
except Unal.

1491
00:54:39.660 --> 00:54:40.960
And part of the island of the

1492
00:54:40.960 --> 00:54:41.800
sons of the dweller.

1493
00:54:42.600 --> 00:54:44.680
Preserved he them to be the teachers.

1494
00:54:45.260 --> 00:54:46.960
Lights on the path for those to

1495
00:54:46.960 --> 00:54:47.520
come after.

1496
00:54:48.180 --> 00:54:50.520
Lights for the lesser children of men.

1497
00:54:51.700 --> 00:54:53.940
Called he then I Thoth before him.

1498
00:54:54.280 --> 00:54:56.160
Gave me commands for all I should

1499
00:54:56.160 --> 00:54:57.000
do saying.

1500
00:54:57.740 --> 00:54:59.940
Take thou O Thoth all of your wisdom.

1501
00:55:00.640 --> 00:55:02.000
Take all your records.

1502
00:55:02.380 --> 00:55:03.600
Take all your magic.

1503
00:55:04.200 --> 00:55:06.460
Go thou forth as a teacher of men.

1504
00:55:07.140 --> 00:55:09.280
Go thou forth reserving the records

1505
00:55:09.280 --> 00:55:12.060
until in time light grows among men.

1506
00:55:12.660 --> 00:55:15.420
Light shall thou be all through the ages.

1507
00:55:15.800 --> 00:55:18.020
Hidden yet found by enlightened men.

1508
00:55:18.900 --> 00:55:21.460
Over all earth give we ye power.

1509
00:55:22.260 --> 00:55:24.260
Free thou to give or take it away.

1510
00:55:25.120 --> 00:55:27.080
Gather thou now the sons of Atlantis.

1511
00:55:27.600 --> 00:55:29.020
Take them and flee to the people

1512
00:55:29.020 --> 00:55:30.100
of the rock caves.

1513
00:55:30.640 --> 00:55:32.440
Fly to the land of the children

1514
00:55:32.440 --> 00:55:33.040
of Kim.

1515
00:55:33.900 --> 00:55:36.160
Then gathered I the sons of Atlantis.

1516
00:55:36.200 --> 00:55:38.520
Into the spaceship I brought all my records.

1517
00:55:38.820 --> 00:55:40.640
Brought the records of sunken Atlantis.

1518
00:55:41.300 --> 00:55:42.820
Gathered I all my powers.

1519
00:55:43.120 --> 00:55:45.180
Instruments many of mighty magic.

1520
00:55:46.180 --> 00:55:48.200
Up then we rose on the wings

1521
00:55:48.200 --> 00:55:48.860
of the morning.

1522
00:55:49.520 --> 00:55:51.260
High we arose above the temple.

1523
00:55:51.500 --> 00:55:53.280
Leaving behind the three and dweller.

1524
00:55:53.520 --> 00:55:55.180
Deep in the halls neath the temple.

1525
00:55:55.760 --> 00:55:57.840
Closing the pathway to the lords of

1526
00:55:57.840 --> 00:55:58.380
the cycles.

1527
00:55:59.220 --> 00:56:01.540
Yet ever to him who has knowing.

1528
00:56:01.540 --> 00:56:03.760
Open shall be the path to Amenti.

1529
00:56:04.540 --> 00:56:06.380
Fast fled we then on the wings

1530
00:56:06.380 --> 00:56:07.020
of the morning.

1531
00:56:07.280 --> 00:56:08.680
Fled to the land of the children

1532
00:56:08.680 --> 00:56:09.220
of Kim.

1533
00:56:09.900 --> 00:56:11.840
There by my power I conquered and

1534
00:56:11.840 --> 00:56:12.400
ruled them.

1535
00:56:12.920 --> 00:56:15.060
Raised I to light the children of Kim.

1536
00:56:15.880 --> 00:56:18.080
Deep neath the rocks I buried my spaceship.

1537
00:56:18.280 --> 00:56:20.320
Waiting the time when man might be free.

1538
00:56:20.960 --> 00:56:23.000
Over the spaceship erected a marker.

1539
00:56:23.440 --> 00:56:24.820
In the form of a lion yet

1540
00:56:24.820 --> 00:56:25.700
likened to man.

1541
00:56:26.500 --> 00:56:29.280
There neath the image rests yet my spaceship.

1542
00:56:29.280 --> 00:56:32.860
Forth to be brought when need shall arise.

1543
00:56:33.580 --> 00:56:35.560
Know ye old man that far in

1544
00:56:35.560 --> 00:56:36.080
the future.

1545
00:56:36.160 --> 00:56:38.520
Invaders shall come from out of the deep.

1546
00:56:39.040 --> 00:56:41.140
Then awake ye who have wisdom.

1547
00:56:41.480 --> 00:56:44.080
Bring forth my ship and conquer with ease.

1548
00:56:45.080 --> 00:56:47.600
Deep neath the image lies my secret.

1549
00:56:47.940 --> 00:56:50.260
Search and find in the pyramid I built.

1550
00:56:50.940 --> 00:56:52.940
Each to the other is the keystone.

1551
00:56:53.400 --> 00:56:55.680
Each the gateway that leads into life.

1552
00:56:56.340 --> 00:56:58.340
Follow the key I leave behind me.

1553
00:56:58.340 --> 00:57:00.800
Seek and the doorway to life shall

1554
00:57:00.800 --> 00:57:01.480
be thine.

1555
00:57:02.200 --> 00:57:04.160
Seek thou in my pyramid deep in

1556
00:57:04.160 --> 00:57:06.000
the passage that ends in a wall.

1557
00:57:06.660 --> 00:57:08.260
Use thou the key of the seven.

1558
00:57:08.820 --> 00:57:11.120
And open to thee the pathway will fall.

1559
00:57:12.080 --> 00:57:14.340
Now unto thee I have given my wisdom.

1560
00:57:15.100 --> 00:57:17.140
Now unto thee I have given my way.

1561
00:57:17.800 --> 00:57:18.680
Follow the pathway.

1562
00:57:19.540 --> 00:57:21.060
Solve thou my secrets.

1563
00:57:21.060 --> 00:57:23.380
Until thee I have shown the way.

1564
00:57:29.440 --> 00:57:31.520
Hark ye old man to the wisdom

1565
00:57:31.520 --> 00:57:32.300
of magic.

1566
00:57:32.840 --> 00:57:34.840
Hark the knowledge of powers forgotten.

1567
00:57:35.600 --> 00:57:37.120
Long ago in the days of the

1568
00:57:37.120 --> 00:57:37.700
first man.

1569
00:57:37.800 --> 00:57:40.000
Warfare began between darkness and light.

1570
00:57:40.680 --> 00:57:42.640
Men then as now were filled with

1571
00:57:42.640 --> 00:57:43.900
both darkness and light.

1572
00:57:44.420 --> 00:57:46.420
And while in some darkness held sway.

1573
00:57:46.780 --> 00:57:48.580
In other light filled the soul.

1574
00:57:49.140 --> 00:57:51.640
Aye age old in this warfare.

1575
00:57:51.860 --> 00:57:53.640
The eternal struggle between darkness

1576
00:57:53.640 --> 00:57:54.300
and light.

1577
00:57:54.740 --> 00:57:57.040
Fiercely is fault all through the ages.

1578
00:57:57.340 --> 00:57:59.580
Using strange powers hidden to man.

1579
00:58:00.540 --> 00:58:02.420
The depths has there been filled with

1580
00:58:02.420 --> 00:58:03.160
the blackness.

1581
00:58:03.420 --> 00:58:05.240
Struggling always against the light.

1582
00:58:05.720 --> 00:58:08.240
But others there are who filled with brightness.

1583
00:58:08.480 --> 00:58:10.140
Have conquered the darkness of night.

1584
00:58:10.740 --> 00:58:12.960
Wherever ye may be in all ages

1585
00:58:12.960 --> 00:58:13.440
and plain.

1586
00:58:13.600 --> 00:58:15.140
Surely ye shall know of the battle

1587
00:58:15.140 --> 00:58:15.780
with night.

1588
00:58:16.340 --> 00:58:18.300
Long ages ago the sons of the

1589
00:58:18.300 --> 00:58:19.060
morning descending.

1590
00:58:19.280 --> 00:58:20.860
Found the world filled with night.

1591
00:58:21.320 --> 00:58:23.160
There in that past began the struggle.

1592
00:58:23.520 --> 00:58:25.680
The age old battle darkness and light.

1593
00:58:26.320 --> 00:58:28.460
Many in time were so filled with darkness.

1594
00:58:28.660 --> 00:58:30.900
That only feebly flame the light from

1595
00:58:30.900 --> 00:58:31.360
the night.

1596
00:58:32.120 --> 00:58:34.120
Some they were masters of darkness.

1597
00:58:34.340 --> 00:58:36.600
Who sought to fill all with their darkness.

1598
00:58:37.040 --> 00:58:39.060
Sought to draw others into their night.

1599
00:58:39.660 --> 00:58:41.400
Fiercely withstood they the masters

1600
00:58:41.400 --> 00:58:42.200
of rightness.

1601
00:58:42.600 --> 00:58:44.340
Fiercely fought they from the darkness

1602
00:58:44.340 --> 00:58:44.900
of night.

1603
00:58:44.900 --> 00:58:47.240
Sought ever to tighten the fetters.

1604
00:58:47.380 --> 00:58:48.960
The chains that bind men to the

1605
00:58:48.960 --> 00:58:49.900
darkness of night.

1606
00:58:50.580 --> 00:58:52.700
Used they always the dark magic.

1607
00:58:53.140 --> 00:58:55.260
Brought into men by the power of darkness.

1608
00:58:55.820 --> 00:58:58.680
Magic that enshrouded man's soul with darkness.

1609
00:58:59.780 --> 00:59:01.600
Banded together as in order.

1610
00:59:01.980 --> 00:59:03.720
Brothers of darkness they through

1611
00:59:03.720 --> 00:59:04.360
the ages.

1612
00:59:04.940 --> 00:59:07.180
Antagonist they to the children of men.

1613
00:59:07.880 --> 00:59:09.880
Walk they always secret and hidden.

1614
00:59:10.160 --> 00:59:12.340
Found yet not found by the children

1615
00:59:12.340 --> 00:59:12.880
of men.

1616
00:59:13.440 --> 00:59:16.240
Forever they walked and worked in darkness.

1617
00:59:16.540 --> 00:59:18.440
Hiding from the light in the darkness

1618
00:59:18.440 --> 00:59:18.980
of night.

1619
00:59:19.640 --> 00:59:22.680
Silently secretly used they their power.

1620
00:59:23.060 --> 00:59:25.460
Enslaving and binding the soul of men.

1621
00:59:26.220 --> 00:59:28.860
Unseen they come and unseen they go.

1622
00:59:29.460 --> 00:59:32.540
Man in his ignorance calls them from below.

1623
00:59:33.980 --> 00:59:35.460
Dark is the way of the dark

1624
00:59:35.460 --> 00:59:36.400
brothers travel.

1625
00:59:36.720 --> 00:59:38.580
Dark of the darkness not of the night.

1626
00:59:38.880 --> 00:59:40.720
Traveling over earth they walk through

1627
00:59:40.720 --> 00:59:41.660
man's dreams.

1628
00:59:41.660 --> 00:59:44.080
Power they have gained from the darkness

1629
00:59:44.080 --> 00:59:44.740
around them.

1630
00:59:44.800 --> 00:59:46.420
To call other dwellers from out of

1631
00:59:46.420 --> 00:59:47.000
their plane.

1632
00:59:47.360 --> 00:59:49.060
In ways that are dark and unseen

1633
00:59:49.060 --> 00:59:49.740
by man.

1634
00:59:50.440 --> 00:59:52.360
Into man's mind space reached the

1635
00:59:52.360 --> 00:59:53.020
dark brothers.

1636
00:59:53.300 --> 00:59:55.240
Around it they closed the veil of

1637
00:59:55.240 --> 00:59:55.760
their night.

1638
00:59:56.480 --> 00:59:58.520
There through its lifetime that soul

1639
00:59:58.520 --> 00:59:59.780
dwells in bondage.

1640
00:59:59.980 --> 01:00:01.640
Bound by the fetters of the veil

1641
01:00:01.640 --> 01:00:02.320
of the night.

1642
01:00:03.080 --> 01:00:05.240
Mighty are they in the forbidden knowledge.

1643
01:00:05.500 --> 01:00:07.840
Forbidden because it is one with the night.

1644
01:00:08.620 --> 01:00:10.900
Hark ye old man and listen to

1645
01:00:10.900 --> 01:00:11.480
my warning.

1646
01:00:12.040 --> 01:00:14.080
Be ye free from the bondage of night.

1647
01:00:14.820 --> 01:00:16.520
Surrender not your soul to the brothers

1648
01:00:16.520 --> 01:00:17.060
of darkness.

1649
01:00:17.680 --> 01:00:19.700
Keep thy face ever turned towards

1650
01:00:19.700 --> 01:00:20.240
the light.

1651
01:00:20.880 --> 01:00:22.800
Know ye not old man that your sorrow.

1652
01:00:23.120 --> 01:00:24.800
Only has come through the veil of

1653
01:00:24.800 --> 01:00:25.200
the night.

1654
01:00:25.880 --> 01:00:27.780
Aye man heed ye my warning.

1655
01:00:28.520 --> 01:00:29.500
Strive ever upward.

1656
01:00:30.020 --> 01:00:31.420
Turn your soul toward the light.

1657
01:00:31.820 --> 01:00:33.300
The brothers of darkness seek for

1658
01:00:33.300 --> 01:00:33.820
their brothers.

1659
01:00:33.980 --> 01:00:35.820
Those who traveled the pathway of light.

1660
01:00:35.820 --> 01:00:38.220
For well know they that those who

1661
01:00:38.220 --> 01:00:38.720
have traveled.

1662
01:00:38.720 --> 01:00:41.220
Far towards the sun in their pathway

1663
01:00:41.220 --> 01:00:41.800
of light.

1664
01:00:41.900 --> 01:00:44.460
Have great and yet greater power.

1665
01:00:44.640 --> 01:00:46.780
To bind with darkness the children

1666
01:00:46.780 --> 01:00:47.440
of light.

1667
01:00:48.280 --> 01:00:50.160
List ye old man to he who

1668
01:00:50.160 --> 01:00:51.040
comes to you.

1669
01:00:51.500 --> 01:00:53.300
But weigh in the balance if his

1670
01:00:53.300 --> 01:00:54.520
words be of light.

1671
01:00:54.780 --> 01:00:56.520
For many there are who walk in

1672
01:00:56.520 --> 01:00:57.160
dark brightness.

1673
01:00:57.460 --> 01:00:59.280
And yet are not the children of light.

1674
01:00:59.960 --> 01:01:01.860
Easy it is to follow their pathway.

1675
01:01:02.120 --> 01:01:04.180
Easy to follow the path that they lead.

1676
01:01:04.180 --> 01:01:06.820
But yet old man heed ye my warning.

1677
01:01:07.440 --> 01:01:09.800
Light comes only to him who strives.

1678
01:01:10.360 --> 01:01:12.260
Hard is the pathway that leads to

1679
01:01:12.260 --> 01:01:12.820
the wisdom.

1680
01:01:13.300 --> 01:01:15.360
Hard is the pathway that leads to

1681
01:01:15.360 --> 01:01:15.860
the light.

1682
01:01:16.300 --> 01:01:18.800
Many shall ye find the stones in

1683
01:01:18.800 --> 01:01:19.380
your pathway.

1684
01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:21.800
Many the mountains to climb toward

1685
01:01:21.800 --> 01:01:22.340
the light.

1686
01:01:22.860 --> 01:01:24.760
Yet know ye old man to him

1687
01:01:24.760 --> 01:01:25.760
that overcometh.

1688
01:01:26.180 --> 01:01:27.720
Free will he be of the pathway

1689
01:01:27.720 --> 01:01:28.180
of light.

1690
01:01:28.760 --> 01:01:30.520
For ye know old man in the

1691
01:01:30.520 --> 01:01:31.760
end light must conquer.

1692
01:01:31.760 --> 01:01:33.560
And darkness and night be banished

1693
01:01:33.560 --> 01:01:34.280
from light.

1694
01:01:35.200 --> 01:01:37.820
Listen old man and heed ye this wisdom.

1695
01:01:38.520 --> 01:01:41.020
Even as darkness so is the light.

1696
01:01:41.680 --> 01:01:43.820
When darkness is banished and all

1697
01:01:43.820 --> 01:01:44.820
veils are rended.

1698
01:01:45.300 --> 01:01:47.280
Out there shall flash from the darkness

1699
01:01:47.280 --> 01:01:48.020
the light.

1700
01:01:48.960 --> 01:01:51.380
Even as exist among men the dark brothers.

1701
01:01:51.640 --> 01:01:53.600
So there exist the brothers of light.

1702
01:01:54.300 --> 01:01:56.340
Antagonists they of the brothers of darkness.

1703
01:01:56.680 --> 01:01:58.420
Seeking to free men from the night.

1704
01:01:59.220 --> 01:02:00.940
Powers have they mighty and potent.

1705
01:02:01.660 --> 01:02:03.640
Knowing the law the planets obey.

1706
01:02:04.180 --> 01:02:06.180
Work they ever in harmony and order.

1707
01:02:06.360 --> 01:02:08.160
Freeing the man soul from its bondage

1708
01:02:08.160 --> 01:02:08.620
of night.

1709
01:02:09.300 --> 01:02:11.240
Secret and hidden walk they also.

1710
01:02:11.920 --> 01:02:13.420
Know not are they to the children

1711
01:02:13.420 --> 01:02:13.980
of men.

1712
01:02:14.440 --> 01:02:16.400
Ever have they fought the dark brothers.

1713
01:02:16.820 --> 01:02:19.580
Conquered and conquering time without end.

1714
01:02:20.220 --> 01:02:22.100
Yet always light shall in the end

1715
01:02:22.100 --> 01:02:22.700
be master.

1716
01:02:23.220 --> 01:02:25.200
Driving away the darkness of night.

1717
01:02:26.200 --> 01:02:28.400
Aye man know ye this knowing.

1718
01:02:28.400 --> 01:02:31.200
Always beside thee walk the children

1719
01:02:31.200 --> 01:02:31.760
of light.

1720
01:02:32.820 --> 01:02:34.640
Masters they of the sun power.

1721
01:02:34.800 --> 01:02:36.880
Ever unseen yet the guardians of men.

1722
01:02:37.540 --> 01:02:39.160
Open to all is their pathway.

1723
01:02:39.400 --> 01:02:40.920
Open to he who will walk in

1724
01:02:40.920 --> 01:02:41.380
the light.

1725
01:02:42.060 --> 01:02:43.540
Free are they of dark amenity.

1726
01:02:43.720 --> 01:02:45.920
Free of the halls where life reigns supreme.

1727
01:02:46.700 --> 01:02:48.700
Sons are they and lords of the morning.

1728
01:02:48.880 --> 01:02:50.640
Children of light to shine among men.

1729
01:02:51.400 --> 01:02:54.600
Like man they are and yet are unalike.

1730
01:02:55.220 --> 01:02:57.120
Never divided were they in the past.

1731
01:02:57.120 --> 01:02:59.500
One have they been in oneness eternal.

1732
01:02:59.860 --> 01:03:01.500
Throughout all space since the beginning

1733
01:03:01.500 --> 01:03:02.100
of time.

1734
01:03:02.760 --> 01:03:04.420
Up did they come in oneness with

1735
01:03:04.420 --> 01:03:05.120
the all one.

1736
01:03:05.540 --> 01:03:08.340
Up from the first space formed and unformed.

1737
01:03:08.980 --> 01:03:10.860
Given to man have they secrets that

1738
01:03:10.860 --> 01:03:13.000
shall guard and protect him from all harm.

1739
01:03:13.660 --> 01:03:15.180
He who would travel the path of

1740
01:03:15.180 --> 01:03:15.700
the master.

1741
01:03:16.220 --> 01:03:17.940
Free must he be from the bondage

1742
01:03:17.940 --> 01:03:18.360
of night.

1743
01:03:19.160 --> 01:03:21.320
Conquer must he the formless and shapeless.

1744
01:03:21.920 --> 01:03:23.900
Conquer must he the phantom of fear.

1745
01:03:24.460 --> 01:03:26.980
Knowing must he gain of all the secrets.

1746
01:03:27.420 --> 01:03:29.140
Travel the pathway that leads through

1747
01:03:29.140 --> 01:03:29.760
the darkness.

1748
01:03:30.220 --> 01:03:32.100
Yet ever before him keep the light

1749
01:03:32.100 --> 01:03:32.860
of his goal.

1750
01:03:33.580 --> 01:03:36.040
Obstacles great shall he meet in the pathway.

1751
01:03:36.620 --> 01:03:38.240
Yet press on to the light of

1752
01:03:38.240 --> 01:03:38.740
the sun.

1753
01:03:39.880 --> 01:03:40.860
Hear ye old man.

1754
01:03:40.980 --> 01:03:42.420
The sun is the symbol of the

1755
01:03:42.420 --> 01:03:43.860
light that shines at the end of

1756
01:03:43.860 --> 01:03:44.460
thy road.

1757
01:03:45.260 --> 01:03:47.180
Now to thee give I the secrets.

1758
01:03:47.420 --> 01:03:48.900
Now to meet the dark power.

1759
01:03:49.220 --> 01:03:51.320
Meet and conquer the fear from the night.

1760
01:03:51.800 --> 01:03:53.480
Only by knowing can ye conquer.

1761
01:03:53.900 --> 01:03:56.060
Only by knowing can ye have light.

1762
01:03:56.660 --> 01:03:58.500
Now I give unto thee the knowledge

1763
01:03:58.500 --> 01:03:59.700
known to the masters.

1764
01:04:00.340 --> 01:04:02.200
The knowing that conquers all the

1765
01:04:02.200 --> 01:04:02.900
dark fears.

1766
01:04:03.500 --> 01:04:04.180
Use this.

1767
01:04:04.540 --> 01:04:05.740
The wisdom I give thee.

1768
01:04:06.320 --> 01:04:08.260
Master thou shalt be of the brothers

1769
01:04:08.260 --> 01:04:08.860
of night.

1770
01:04:09.660 --> 01:04:11.360
When unto thee comes a feeling.

1771
01:04:11.980 --> 01:04:14.060
Drawing thee nearer to the darker gate.

1772
01:04:14.580 --> 01:04:16.360
Examine thine heart and find if the

1773
01:04:16.360 --> 01:04:18.360
feeling thou hast have come from within.

1774
01:04:19.020 --> 01:04:21.360
If thou shalt find the darkness thine

1775
01:04:21.360 --> 01:04:22.020
own words.

1776
01:04:22.020 --> 01:04:24.260
Banish them forth from the place in

1777
01:04:24.260 --> 01:04:24.860
thy mind.

1778
01:04:25.680 --> 01:04:28.040
Send through thy body a wave of vibration.

1779
01:04:28.580 --> 01:04:30.540
Irregular first and regular second.

1780
01:04:30.680 --> 01:04:32.660
Repeating time after time until free.

1781
01:04:33.320 --> 01:04:35.760
Start the wave force in thy brain center.

1782
01:04:36.320 --> 01:04:38.300
Directed in waves from thine head

1783
01:04:38.300 --> 01:04:39.380
to thy foot.

1784
01:04:40.300 --> 01:04:42.620
But if thy findest thine heart is

1785
01:04:42.620 --> 01:04:43.360
not darkened.

1786
01:04:43.480 --> 01:04:45.160
Be sure that a force is directed

1787
01:04:45.160 --> 01:04:45.620
to thee.

1788
01:04:46.240 --> 01:04:48.340
Only by knowing can thou overcome it.

1789
01:04:48.940 --> 01:04:50.740
Only by wisdom can thou hope to

1790
01:04:50.740 --> 01:04:51.220
be free.

1791
01:04:51.780 --> 01:04:53.660
Knowledge brings wisdom and wisdom

1792
01:04:53.660 --> 01:04:54.300
is power.

1793
01:04:54.800 --> 01:04:57.480
Attain and ye shall have power over all.

1794
01:04:58.720 --> 01:05:01.140
Seek ye first a place bound by darkness.

1795
01:05:01.640 --> 01:05:03.740
Place ye a circle around about thee.

1796
01:05:04.300 --> 01:05:06.420
Stand erect in the midst of the circle.

1797
01:05:07.200 --> 01:05:09.520
Use thou this formula and you shall

1798
01:05:09.520 --> 01:05:10.100
be free.

1799
01:05:10.860 --> 01:05:13.160
Raise thou thine hands to the dark

1800
01:05:13.160 --> 01:05:14.220
space above thee.

1801
01:05:14.960 --> 01:05:16.840
Close thou thine eyes and draw in

1802
01:05:16.840 --> 01:05:17.400
the light.

1803
01:05:17.960 --> 01:05:19.680
Call to the spirit of the light

1804
01:05:19.680 --> 01:05:20.840
through the space time.

1805
01:05:21.280 --> 01:05:24.500
Using these words and thou shalt be free.

1806
01:05:25.060 --> 01:05:27.640
Fill thy my body O spirit of life.

1807
01:05:28.160 --> 01:05:30.560
Fill thy my body with spirit of light.

1808
01:05:31.200 --> 01:05:33.320
Come from the flower that shines through

1809
01:05:33.320 --> 01:05:33.940
the darkness.

1810
01:05:34.660 --> 01:05:37.040
Come from the halls where seven lords rule.

1811
01:05:37.880 --> 01:05:39.540
Name them by name I the seven.

1812
01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:45.140
Three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.

1813
01:05:45.780 --> 01:05:47.420
By their names I call them to

1814
01:05:47.420 --> 01:05:47.900
aid me.

1815
01:05:48.460 --> 01:05:50.440
Free me and save me from the

1816
01:05:50.440 --> 01:05:51.380
darkness of night.

1817
01:06:00.100 --> 01:06:02.220
By their names I implore thee.

1818
01:06:02.360 --> 01:06:04.220
Free me from darkness and fill me

1819
01:06:04.220 --> 01:06:04.860
with light.

1820
01:06:05.940 --> 01:06:07.980
Know ye O man that when ye

1821
01:06:07.980 --> 01:06:08.760
have done this.

1822
01:06:08.900 --> 01:06:10.660
Ye shall be free from the fetters

1823
01:06:10.660 --> 01:06:11.480
that bind ye.

1824
01:06:11.700 --> 01:06:13.400
Cast off the bondage of the brothers

1825
01:06:13.400 --> 01:06:13.900
of night.

1826
01:06:14.600 --> 01:06:16.480
See ye not that the names have

1827
01:06:16.480 --> 01:06:17.620
the power to free.

1828
01:06:17.980 --> 01:06:20.300
By vibration the fetters that bind.

1829
01:06:20.980 --> 01:06:23.000
Use them at night to free thou

1830
01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:23.680
thine brother.

1831
01:06:23.860 --> 01:06:25.840
So that he too may come forth

1832
01:06:25.840 --> 01:06:26.660
from the night.

1833
01:06:27.440 --> 01:06:29.920
Thou O man art thy brother's helper.

1834
01:06:30.540 --> 01:06:32.560
Let him not lie in the bondage

1835
01:06:32.560 --> 01:06:33.040
of night.

1836
01:06:34.040 --> 01:06:36.300
Now unto thee give I my magic.

1837
01:06:37.060 --> 01:06:39.100
Take it and dwell on the pathway

1838
01:06:39.100 --> 01:06:39.720
of light.

1839
01:06:40.240 --> 01:06:42.540
Light unto thee, life unto thee.

1840
01:06:42.540 --> 01:06:45.520
Sun may thou be on the cycle above.

1841
01:06:55.780 --> 01:06:58.060
Hark ye O man and listen to

1842
01:06:58.060 --> 01:06:58.720
my voice.

1843
01:06:59.240 --> 01:07:01.220
Open thy mind space and drink of

1844
01:07:01.220 --> 01:07:01.900
my wisdom.

1845
01:07:02.640 --> 01:07:04.720
Dark is the pathway of life that

1846
01:07:04.720 --> 01:07:05.380
ye travel.

1847
01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:08.420
Many the pitfalls that lie in thy way.

1848
01:07:09.300 --> 01:07:11.560
Seek ye ever to gain greater wisdom.

1849
01:07:12.140 --> 01:07:14.620
Attain and it shall be on thy way.

1850
01:07:15.440 --> 01:07:17.420
Open thy soul O man to the cosmic.

1851
01:07:17.560 --> 01:07:19.020
And let it flow in as one

1852
01:07:19.020 --> 01:07:19.860
with thy soul.

1853
01:07:20.560 --> 01:07:23.360
Light is eternal and darkness is fleeting.

1854
01:07:23.960 --> 01:07:25.840
Seek ye ever O man for the light.

1855
01:07:26.620 --> 01:07:28.800
Know ye that ever as light fills

1856
01:07:28.800 --> 01:07:29.440
thy being.

1857
01:07:29.600 --> 01:07:31.640
Darkness for thee shall soon disappear.

1858
01:07:32.400 --> 01:07:34.600
Open thy souls to the brothers of brightness.

1859
01:07:35.280 --> 01:07:37.560
Let them enter and fill thee with light.

1860
01:07:38.380 --> 01:07:39.980
Lift up thine eyes to the light

1861
01:07:39.980 --> 01:07:40.640
of the cosmos.

1862
01:07:40.640 --> 01:07:43.380
Keep thou ever thy face to the goal.

1863
01:07:43.920 --> 01:07:45.580
Only by gaining the light of all

1864
01:07:45.580 --> 01:07:48.240
wisdom art thou one with the infinite goal.

1865
01:07:48.960 --> 01:07:50.700
Seek ye ever the oneness eternal.

1866
01:07:51.360 --> 01:07:53.380
Seek ever the light of the goal.

1867
01:07:55.040 --> 01:07:58.420
Light is infinite and light is finite.

1868
01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:00.860
Separate only by darkness in man.

1869
01:08:01.420 --> 01:08:03.080
Seek ye to rend the veil of

1870
01:08:03.080 --> 01:08:03.580
the darkness.

1871
01:08:04.040 --> 01:08:06.260
Bring thou together the light into one.

1872
01:08:06.900 --> 01:08:08.000
Hear ye O man.

1873
01:08:08.260 --> 01:08:10.160
List to my voice singing the song

1874
01:08:10.160 --> 01:08:11.460
of light and of life.

1875
01:08:12.060 --> 01:08:14.320
Throughout all space light is prevalent.

1876
01:08:14.760 --> 01:08:16.500
Encompassing all with its banners

1877
01:08:16.500 --> 01:08:17.260
of flames.

1878
01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:19.680
Seek ye forever in the veil of

1879
01:08:19.680 --> 01:08:20.180
the darkness.

1880
01:08:20.560 --> 01:08:22.780
Somewhere ye shall surely find light.

1881
01:08:23.480 --> 01:08:24.440
Hidden and buried.

1882
01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:26.220
Lost to man's knowledge.

1883
01:08:26.460 --> 01:08:28.580
Deep in the finite the infinite exists.

1884
01:08:29.400 --> 01:08:30.700
Lost but existing.

1885
01:08:31.260 --> 01:08:32.600
Flowing through all things.

1886
01:08:32.760 --> 01:08:34.940
Living in all is the infinite brain.

1887
01:08:34.940 --> 01:08:38.300
In all space there is only one wisdom.

1888
01:08:39.240 --> 01:08:40.760
Though seeming divided.

1889
01:08:41.180 --> 01:08:42.980
It is one in the one.

1890
01:08:43.560 --> 01:08:46.120
All that exists comes forth from the light.

1891
01:08:46.300 --> 01:08:48.500
And the light comes forth from the all.

1892
01:08:49.940 --> 01:08:52.560
Everything created is based upon order.

1893
01:08:53.080 --> 01:08:56.500
Law rules the space where the infinite dwells.

1894
01:08:56.760 --> 01:08:59.520
Forth from equilibrium came the great cycles.

1895
01:08:59.680 --> 01:09:02.080
Moving in harmony toward infinity's end.

1896
01:09:02.880 --> 01:09:03.800
Know ye O man.

1897
01:09:03.800 --> 01:09:06.060
That far in this space time infinity

1898
01:09:06.060 --> 01:09:08.500
itself shall pass into change.

1899
01:09:09.140 --> 01:09:10.720
Hear ye and list to the voice

1900
01:09:10.720 --> 01:09:11.280
of wisdom.

1901
01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.220
Know that all is of all evermore.

1902
01:09:14.860 --> 01:09:17.100
Know that through time thou may pursue

1903
01:09:17.100 --> 01:09:19.000
wisdom and find evermore light on

1904
01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:19.400
the way.

1905
01:09:20.060 --> 01:09:20.360
Ay.

1906
01:09:20.600 --> 01:09:22.980
Thou shalt find that ever receding.

1907
01:09:23.240 --> 01:09:25.480
Thy goal shall elude thee from day

1908
01:09:25.480 --> 01:09:26.260
unto day.

1909
01:09:26.960 --> 01:09:29.200
Long time ago in the halls of Amenti.

1910
01:09:29.380 --> 01:09:29.680
Ay.

1911
01:09:30.180 --> 01:09:30.560
Thoth.

1912
01:09:31.060 --> 01:09:33.140
Stood before the lords of the cycles.

1913
01:09:33.140 --> 01:09:35.920
Mighty they in their aspects of power.

1914
01:09:36.260 --> 01:09:38.560
Mighty they in the wisdom unveiled.

1915
01:09:40.400 --> 01:09:41.600
Led by the dweller.

1916
01:09:41.860 --> 01:09:43.140
First did I see them.

1917
01:09:43.420 --> 01:09:45.940
But afterwards free I was of their presence.

1918
01:09:46.480 --> 01:09:48.580
Free to enter their conclave at will.

1919
01:09:49.620 --> 01:09:51.800
Oft did I journey down the dark pathway.

1920
01:09:51.980 --> 01:09:54.560
Unto the hall where the light ever glows.

1921
01:09:55.320 --> 01:09:57.340
Learned I of the masters of cycles.

1922
01:09:57.880 --> 01:10:00.120
Wisdom brought from the cycles above us.

1923
01:10:00.460 --> 01:10:02.540
Knowledge brought from infinities all.

1924
01:10:03.140 --> 01:10:05.100
Many the questions I ask of the

1925
01:10:05.100 --> 01:10:06.000
lords of the cycles.

1926
01:10:06.680 --> 01:10:08.900
Great was the wisdom they gave unto me.

1927
01:10:09.480 --> 01:10:11.940
Now unto thee I give of this wisdom.

1928
01:10:12.620 --> 01:10:15.180
Drawn from the flame of infinities fire.

1929
01:10:16.240 --> 01:10:18.680
Deep in the dark halls sit the seven.

1930
01:10:19.480 --> 01:10:22.060
Units of consciousness from cycles above.

1931
01:10:22.860 --> 01:10:25.240
Manifest they in this cycle as guide

1932
01:10:25.240 --> 01:10:27.040
of man to the knowledge of all.

1933
01:10:27.680 --> 01:10:28.420
Seven are they.

1934
01:10:28.900 --> 01:10:29.780
Mighty in power.

1935
01:10:30.260 --> 01:10:32.660
Speaking these words through men to men.

1936
01:10:33.140 --> 01:10:35.700
Time after time stood I before them.

1937
01:10:35.760 --> 01:10:38.880
Listening to words that came not with sound.

1938
01:10:40.280 --> 01:10:41.940
Once said they unto me.

1939
01:10:42.260 --> 01:10:44.600
O man whatst thou gain wisdom?

1940
01:10:45.240 --> 01:10:46.620
Seek for it in the heart of

1941
01:10:46.620 --> 01:10:47.120
the flame.

1942
01:10:47.600 --> 01:10:49.560
Whatst thou gain knowledge of power?

1943
01:10:50.340 --> 01:10:52.060
Seek ye it in the heart of

1944
01:10:52.060 --> 01:10:52.620
the flame.

1945
01:10:53.620 --> 01:10:55.120
Whatst be one with the heart of

1946
01:10:55.120 --> 01:10:55.560
the flame?

1947
01:10:56.340 --> 01:10:58.780
Seek then within thine own hidden flame.

1948
01:10:59.800 --> 01:11:01.880
Many the times spoke they to me.

1949
01:11:01.880 --> 01:11:03.960
Teaching me wisdom not of the world.

1950
01:11:04.500 --> 01:11:06.580
Showing me ever new paths to brightness.

1951
01:11:06.960 --> 01:11:08.820
Teaching me wisdom brought from above.

1952
01:11:09.540 --> 01:11:11.300
Giving knowledge of operation.

1953
01:11:11.680 --> 01:11:12.600
Learning of law.

1954
01:11:13.060 --> 01:11:14.340
The order of all.

1955
01:11:15.300 --> 01:11:17.700
Spoke to me again the seven saying.

1956
01:11:18.280 --> 01:11:20.240
From far beyond time are we come

1957
01:11:20.240 --> 01:11:20.740
O man.

1958
01:11:21.300 --> 01:11:23.540
Travelled we from beyond the space time.

1959
01:11:23.880 --> 01:11:26.160
I from the place of infinities end.

1960
01:11:26.720 --> 01:11:28.500
When ye and all of thy brethren

1961
01:11:28.500 --> 01:11:29.320
were formless.

1962
01:11:29.320 --> 01:11:31.720
Formed forth were we from the order

1963
01:11:31.720 --> 01:11:32.280
of all.

1964
01:11:33.020 --> 01:11:34.740
Not as men are we though once

1965
01:11:34.740 --> 01:11:36.420
we too were as men.

1966
01:11:37.120 --> 01:11:38.820
Out of the great void were we

1967
01:11:38.820 --> 01:11:41.120
formed forth in order and by law.

1968
01:11:41.900 --> 01:11:43.940
For know ye that which is formed

1969
01:11:43.940 --> 01:11:45.220
truly is formless.

1970
01:11:45.480 --> 01:11:47.820
Having form only to thine eyes.

1971
01:11:48.580 --> 01:11:51.040
And again unto me spoke the seven saying.

1972
01:11:51.760 --> 01:11:53.800
Child of the light O Thoth.

1973
01:11:54.140 --> 01:11:55.880
Art thou free to travel the bright

1974
01:11:55.880 --> 01:11:56.580
path upward.

1975
01:11:56.580 --> 01:11:59.720
Until at the last all ones become one.

1976
01:12:01.340 --> 01:12:04.020
Forth were we formed after our order.

1977
01:12:04.460 --> 01:12:07.560
Three four five and six seven eight nine.

1978
01:12:08.400 --> 01:12:10.040
Know ye that these are the number

1979
01:12:10.040 --> 01:12:10.660
of cycles.

1980
01:12:10.900 --> 01:12:12.680
That we descend from unto man.

1981
01:12:13.040 --> 01:12:15.360
Each having here a duty to fulfill.

1982
01:12:15.640 --> 01:12:17.780
Each having here a force to control.

1983
01:12:18.660 --> 01:12:20.900
Yet are we one with the soul

1984
01:12:20.900 --> 01:12:21.660
of our cycle.

1985
01:12:22.280 --> 01:12:24.340
Yet are we too seeking a goal.

1986
01:12:24.340 --> 01:12:26.540
Far beyond man's conception.

1987
01:12:26.700 --> 01:12:29.120
Infinity extends into a greater than all.

1988
01:12:29.700 --> 01:12:31.560
There in a time that is yet

1989
01:12:31.560 --> 01:12:32.420
not a time.

1990
01:12:32.720 --> 01:12:34.360
We shall all become one with a

1991
01:12:34.360 --> 01:12:35.200
greater than all.

1992
01:12:35.720 --> 01:12:37.880
Time and space are moving in circles.

1993
01:12:38.580 --> 01:12:40.660
Know ye their law and ye too

1994
01:12:40.660 --> 01:12:41.540
shall be free.

1995
01:12:42.200 --> 01:12:44.500
I free shall ye be to move

1996
01:12:44.500 --> 01:12:45.440
through the cycles.

1997
01:12:45.840 --> 01:12:48.160
Past the guardians that dwell at the door.

1998
01:12:48.860 --> 01:12:51.560
Then to me spoke he of nine saying.

1999
01:12:52.340 --> 01:12:54.600
Eons and eons have I existed.

2000
01:12:55.180 --> 01:12:57.580
Knowing not life and tasting not death.

2001
01:12:58.080 --> 01:12:59.840
For know ye old man that far

2002
01:12:59.840 --> 01:13:00.500
in the future.

2003
01:13:00.640 --> 01:13:02.440
Life and death shall be one with

2004
01:13:02.440 --> 01:13:02.920
the all.

2005
01:13:03.600 --> 01:13:06.440
Each so perfected by balancing the other.

2006
01:13:06.580 --> 01:13:08.380
That neither exist in the oneness

2007
01:13:08.380 --> 01:13:08.880
of all.

2008
01:13:09.780 --> 01:13:11.480
In men of this cycle the life

2009
01:13:11.480 --> 01:13:12.460
force is rampant.

2010
01:13:12.840 --> 01:13:15.120
But life in its growth becomes one

2011
01:13:15.120 --> 01:13:15.820
with the all.

2012
01:13:16.320 --> 01:13:19.320
Here I manifest in this your cycle.

2013
01:13:19.320 --> 01:13:21.540
But yet am I there in your

2014
01:13:21.540 --> 01:13:22.500
future of time.

2015
01:13:23.140 --> 01:13:25.040
Yet to me time exists not.

2016
01:13:25.420 --> 01:13:27.760
For in my world time exists not.

2017
01:13:28.180 --> 01:13:29.640
For formless are we.

2018
01:13:30.100 --> 01:13:32.740
Life have we not but yet have existence.

2019
01:13:33.040 --> 01:13:35.620
Fuller and greater and freer than thee.

2020
01:13:37.820 --> 01:13:40.160
Man is a flame bound to a mountain.

2021
01:13:40.700 --> 01:13:42.620
But we in our cycle shall ever

2022
01:13:42.620 --> 01:13:43.220
be free.

2023
01:13:43.840 --> 01:13:45.300
Know ye old man that when ye

2024
01:13:45.300 --> 01:13:46.020
have progressed.

2025
01:13:46.180 --> 01:13:47.980
Into the cycles that lengthen above.

2026
01:13:47.980 --> 01:13:50.220
Life itself will pass to the darkness.

2027
01:13:50.700 --> 01:13:53.500
And only the essence of soul shall remain.

2028
01:13:54.420 --> 01:13:55.900
Then to me spoke the Lord of

2029
01:13:55.900 --> 01:13:56.840
the eight saying.

2030
01:13:57.540 --> 01:13:59.240
All that ye know is but part

2031
01:13:59.240 --> 01:13:59.740
of little.

2032
01:14:00.560 --> 01:14:02.500
Not as yet have ye touched on

2033
01:14:02.500 --> 01:14:03.000
the great.

2034
01:14:03.420 --> 01:14:06.000
Far out in space where light reigns supreme.

2035
01:14:06.280 --> 01:14:07.640
Came I into the light.

2036
01:14:08.140 --> 01:14:10.620
Formed was I also but not as

2037
01:14:10.620 --> 01:14:11.080
ye are.

2038
01:14:11.680 --> 01:14:14.540
Body of light was my formless form formed.

2039
01:14:15.150 --> 01:14:17.720
Know I not life and know I

2040
01:14:17.720 --> 01:14:18.520
not death.

2041
01:14:18.740 --> 01:14:21.400
Yet master am I of all that exist.

2042
01:14:22.180 --> 01:14:23.760
Seek ye to find the path through

2043
01:14:23.760 --> 01:14:24.400
the barriers.

2044
01:14:24.960 --> 01:14:27.240
Travel the road that leads to the light.

2045
01:14:27.980 --> 01:14:29.980
Spoke again to me the nine saying.

2046
01:14:30.600 --> 01:14:32.540
Seek ye to find the path to beyond.

2047
01:14:33.120 --> 01:14:34.900
Not impossible is it to grow to

2048
01:14:34.900 --> 01:14:36.180
a consciousness above.

2049
01:14:36.520 --> 01:14:38.180
For when two have become one.

2050
01:14:38.340 --> 01:14:39.900
And one has become the all.

2051
01:14:40.340 --> 01:14:41.980
Know ye the barrier has lifted.

2052
01:14:42.420 --> 01:14:44.020
And ye are made free of the road.

2053
01:14:44.540 --> 01:14:46.960
Grow thou from form to the formless.

2054
01:14:47.560 --> 01:14:49.360
Free may thou be of the road.

2055
01:14:50.500 --> 01:14:52.680
Thus through ages I listened.

2056
01:14:53.040 --> 01:14:54.540
Learning the way to the all.

2057
01:14:55.240 --> 01:14:56.980
Now lift I my thought to the

2058
01:14:56.980 --> 01:14:57.680
all thing.

2059
01:14:58.380 --> 01:15:00.460
List ye and hear when it calls.

2060
01:15:01.140 --> 01:15:03.040
O light all pervading.

2061
01:15:03.540 --> 01:15:05.800
One with all and all with one.

2062
01:15:06.280 --> 01:15:08.720
Flow thou to me through the channel.

2063
01:15:09.420 --> 01:15:11.460
Enter thou so that I may be free.

2064
01:15:11.820 --> 01:15:13.700
Make me one with the all soul.

2065
01:15:13.700 --> 01:15:15.620
Shining from the blackness of night.

2066
01:15:16.200 --> 01:15:18.420
Free let me be of all space time.

2067
01:15:18.580 --> 01:15:20.120
Free from the veil of the night.

2068
01:15:20.680 --> 01:15:22.880
I a child of the light command.

2069
01:15:23.740 --> 01:15:25.480
Free from the darkness to be.

2070
01:15:26.520 --> 01:15:29.020
Formless am I to the light soul.

2071
01:15:29.480 --> 01:15:31.620
Formless yet shining with light.

2072
01:15:32.600 --> 01:15:34.340
Know I the bonds of the darkness.

2073
01:15:34.620 --> 01:15:36.440
Must shatter and fall before light.

2074
01:15:37.660 --> 01:15:39.600
Now give I this wisdom.

2075
01:15:40.280 --> 01:15:41.860
Free may ye be old man.

2076
01:15:41.940 --> 01:15:43.380
Living in light and in brightness.

2077
01:15:43.700 --> 01:15:45.900
Turn not thy face from the light.

2078
01:15:46.400 --> 01:15:48.560
Thy soul dwells in realms of brightness.

2079
01:15:49.060 --> 01:15:50.720
Ye are a child of the light.

2080
01:15:51.360 --> 01:15:53.300
Turn thy thoughts inward not outward.

2081
01:15:54.220 --> 01:15:56.160
Find thou the light soul within.

2082
01:15:56.860 --> 01:15:58.480
Know that thou are the master.

2083
01:15:59.120 --> 01:16:00.960
All else is brought from within.

2084
01:16:01.640 --> 01:16:03.680
Grow thou to the realms of brightness.

2085
01:16:04.440 --> 01:16:06.520
Hold thou thy thought on the light.

2086
01:16:07.180 --> 01:16:09.120
Know thou are one with the cosmos.

2087
01:16:09.360 --> 01:16:11.300
A flame and a child of the light.

2088
01:16:11.860 --> 01:16:13.660
Now to thee I give warning.

2089
01:16:14.380 --> 01:16:16.520
Let not thy thought turn away.

2090
01:16:17.080 --> 01:16:18.780
Know that the brightness flows through

2091
01:16:18.780 --> 01:16:20.020
thy body for I.

2092
01:16:20.520 --> 01:16:22.340
Turn not to the dark brightness that

2093
01:16:22.340 --> 01:16:24.000
comes from the brothers of black.

2094
01:16:24.260 --> 01:16:26.200
But keep thine eyes ever lifted.

2095
01:16:26.640 --> 01:16:28.560
Thy soul in tune with the light.

2096
01:16:29.240 --> 01:16:31.040
Take ye this wisdom and heed it.

2097
01:16:31.620 --> 01:16:33.340
List to my voice and obey.

2098
01:16:33.900 --> 01:16:35.400
Follow the pathway to brightness.

2099
01:16:35.960 --> 01:16:38.460
And thou shalt be one with the way.

2100
01:16:44.820 --> 01:16:47.160
Unto thee, O man, have I given

2101
01:16:47.160 --> 01:16:47.940
my knowledge.

2102
01:16:48.300 --> 01:16:50.040
Unto thee have I given of light.

2103
01:16:50.580 --> 01:16:52.380
Hear ye now and receive my wisdom

2104
01:16:52.380 --> 01:16:54.940
brought from space planes above and beyond.

2105
01:16:55.920 --> 01:16:57.460
Not as man am I.

2106
01:16:57.560 --> 01:16:59.300
For free have I become of dimensions

2107
01:16:59.300 --> 01:16:59.940
and planes.

2108
01:17:00.520 --> 01:17:02.640
In each take I on a new body.

2109
01:17:02.980 --> 01:17:04.740
In each I change in my form.

2110
01:17:05.260 --> 01:17:07.120
Know I now that the formless is

2111
01:17:07.120 --> 01:17:08.440
all there is of form.

2112
01:17:09.040 --> 01:17:10.940
Great is the wisdom of the seven.

2113
01:17:11.300 --> 01:17:13.080
Mighty are they from beyond.

2114
01:17:13.680 --> 01:17:15.820
Manifest they through the power filled

2115
01:17:15.820 --> 01:17:17.240
by force from beyond.

2116
01:17:18.020 --> 01:17:19.780
Hear ye these words of wisdom.

2117
01:17:20.300 --> 01:17:22.020
Hear ye and make them thine own.

2118
01:17:22.540 --> 01:17:24.040
Find in them the formless.

2119
01:17:24.260 --> 01:17:25.920
Find ye the key to beyond.

2120
01:17:26.520 --> 01:17:28.180
Mystery is but hidden knowledge.

2121
01:17:28.760 --> 01:17:30.380
Know and ye shall unveil.

2122
01:17:30.740 --> 01:17:32.740
Find the deep buried wisdom and be

2123
01:17:32.740 --> 01:17:34.660
master of darkness and light.

2124
01:17:36.060 --> 01:17:38.160
Deep are the mysteries around thee.

2125
01:17:38.360 --> 01:17:40.020
Hidden the secrets of old.

2126
01:17:40.020 --> 01:17:42.420
Search through the keys of my wisdom.

2127
01:17:43.080 --> 01:17:44.740
Surely shall ye find the way.

2128
01:17:45.280 --> 01:17:47.080
The gateway to power is secret.

2129
01:17:47.720 --> 01:17:49.740
But he who attains shall receive.

2130
01:17:50.540 --> 01:17:52.120
Look to the light, O my brother.

2131
01:17:52.660 --> 01:17:54.420
Open and ye shall receive.

2132
01:17:55.040 --> 01:17:56.740
Press on through the valley of darkness.

2133
01:17:57.440 --> 01:17:59.080
Overcome the dweller of the night.

2134
01:17:59.620 --> 01:18:01.760
Keep ever thine eyes to the light plane.

2135
01:18:02.180 --> 01:18:04.040
And thou shalt be one with the light.

2136
01:18:04.660 --> 01:18:07.000
Man is in the process of changing

2137
01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:08.800
to forms that are not of this world.

2138
01:18:09.440 --> 01:18:11.480
Grows he in time to the formless.

2139
01:18:11.860 --> 01:18:13.720
A plane on the cycle above.

2140
01:18:14.460 --> 01:18:14.980
Know ye.

2141
01:18:15.500 --> 01:18:17.660
Ye must become formless before ye

2142
01:18:17.660 --> 01:18:18.880
are one with the light.

2143
01:18:19.800 --> 01:18:21.540
List ye, O man, to my voice.

2144
01:18:22.080 --> 01:18:23.940
Telling of the pathways to light.

2145
01:18:24.600 --> 01:18:26.580
Showing the way of attainment when

2146
01:18:26.580 --> 01:18:28.400
ye shall be one with the light.

2147
01:18:29.140 --> 01:18:31.540
Search ye the mysteries of earth's heart.

2148
01:18:32.140 --> 01:18:33.760
Learn of the law that exists.

2149
01:18:34.400 --> 01:18:36.180
Holding the stars in their balance

2150
01:18:36.180 --> 01:18:38.280
by the force of their primordial mist.

2151
01:18:38.800 --> 01:18:41.380
Seek ye the flame of the earth's life.

2152
01:18:41.980 --> 01:18:43.700
Bathe in the glare of its flame.

2153
01:18:44.280 --> 01:18:45.900
Follow the three-cornered pathway

2154
01:18:45.900 --> 01:18:48.800
until thou too art a flame.

2155
01:18:50.480 --> 01:18:52.960
Speak thou in words without voice

2156
01:18:52.960 --> 01:18:54.720
to those who dwell down below.

2157
01:18:55.480 --> 01:18:57.020
Enter the blue-liddened temple and

2158
01:18:57.020 --> 01:18:58.840
bathe in the fire of all life.

2159
01:18:59.780 --> 01:19:01.780
Know, O man, thou art complex.

2160
01:19:01.920 --> 01:19:03.500
A being of earth and of fire.

2161
01:19:04.120 --> 01:19:06.100
Let thy flame shine out brightly.

2162
01:19:06.480 --> 01:19:07.960
Be thou only the fire.

2163
01:19:08.800 --> 01:19:10.440
Wisdom is hidden in darkness.

2164
01:19:10.980 --> 01:19:12.400
When lit by the flame of the

2165
01:19:12.400 --> 01:19:15.080
soul, find thou the wisdom and be

2166
01:19:15.080 --> 01:19:15.700
light-born.

2167
01:19:16.020 --> 01:19:17.960
A son of the light without form.

2168
01:19:18.740 --> 01:19:20.140
Seek thee evermore wisdom.

2169
01:19:21.020 --> 01:19:22.700
Find it in the heart of the flame.

2170
01:19:23.340 --> 01:19:25.360
Know that only by striving can light

2171
01:19:25.360 --> 01:19:26.940
pour into thy brain.

2172
01:19:27.740 --> 01:19:29.500
Now have I spoken with wisdom.

2173
01:19:30.180 --> 01:19:31.640
List to my voice and obey.

2174
01:19:32.320 --> 01:19:34.080
Tear open the veils of the darkness.

2175
01:19:34.800 --> 01:19:36.440
Shine a light on the way.

2176
01:19:37.060 --> 01:19:39.380
Speak I of ancient Atlantis.

2177
01:19:39.660 --> 01:19:41.480
Speak of the days of the kingdom

2178
01:19:41.480 --> 01:19:42.120
of shadows.

2179
01:19:42.780 --> 01:19:44.180
Speak of the coming of the children

2180
01:19:44.180 --> 01:19:44.820
of shadows.

2181
01:19:45.500 --> 01:19:46.960
Out of the great deep were they

2182
01:19:46.960 --> 01:19:48.740
called by the wisdom of earth-men,

2183
01:19:49.280 --> 01:19:50.800
called for the purpose of gaining

2184
01:19:50.800 --> 01:19:51.640
great power.

2185
01:19:53.300 --> 01:19:55.940
Far in the past before Atlantis existed,

2186
01:19:56.180 --> 01:19:58.380
men there were who delved into darkness,

2187
01:19:58.760 --> 01:20:01.060
using dark magic, calling up beings

2188
01:20:01.060 --> 01:20:02.740
from the great deep below us.

2189
01:20:03.380 --> 01:20:05.300
Forth came they into this cycle.

2190
01:20:05.980 --> 01:20:07.920
Formless were they of another vibration,

2191
01:20:08.140 --> 01:20:10.080
existing unseen by the children of

2192
01:20:10.080 --> 01:20:10.660
earth-men.

2193
01:20:11.480 --> 01:20:13.100
Only through blood could they have

2194
01:20:13.100 --> 01:20:14.040
formed being.

2195
01:20:14.680 --> 01:20:16.520
Only through man could they live in

2196
01:20:16.520 --> 01:20:16.960
the world.

2197
01:20:17.800 --> 01:20:20.220
In ages past were they conquered by

2198
01:20:20.220 --> 01:20:22.380
the masters, driven below to the place

2199
01:20:22.380 --> 01:20:23.220
whence they came.

2200
01:20:23.780 --> 01:20:25.900
But some there were who remained,

2201
01:20:26.080 --> 01:20:27.860
hidden in spaces and planes unknown

2202
01:20:27.860 --> 01:20:28.460
to man.

2203
01:20:29.020 --> 01:20:31.160
Lived they in Atlantis as shadows,

2204
01:20:31.620 --> 01:20:33.580
but at times they appeared among men.

2205
01:20:34.080 --> 01:20:36.520
Aye, when the blood was offered, forth

2206
01:20:36.520 --> 01:20:38.280
came they to dwell among men.

2207
01:20:39.700 --> 01:20:41.980
In the form of man moved they

2208
01:20:41.980 --> 01:20:43.920
amongst us, but only to sight were

2209
01:20:43.920 --> 01:20:45.020
they as our men.

2210
01:20:45.660 --> 01:20:47.380
Serpent-headed when the glamour was

2211
01:20:47.380 --> 01:20:49.440
lifted, but appearing to man as men

2212
01:20:49.440 --> 01:20:50.180
among men.

2213
01:20:51.040 --> 01:20:53.320
Crept they into the councils, taking

2214
01:20:53.320 --> 01:20:55.040
forms that were likened to men.

2215
01:20:55.040 --> 01:20:57.580
Slaying by their arts the chiefs of

2216
01:20:57.580 --> 01:20:59.780
the kingdoms, taking their form and

2217
01:20:59.780 --> 01:21:00.700
ruling over man.

2218
01:21:01.280 --> 01:21:03.160
Only by magic could they be discovered.

2219
01:21:03.700 --> 01:21:06.000
Only by sound could their faces be seen.

2220
01:21:06.580 --> 01:21:08.400
Sought they from the kingdom of shadows

2221
01:21:08.400 --> 01:21:10.860
to destroy man and rule in his place.

2222
01:21:11.440 --> 01:21:13.760
But know ye, the masters were mighty

2223
01:21:13.760 --> 01:21:14.360
in magic,

2224
01:21:14.780 --> 01:21:16.340
able to lift the veil from the

2225
01:21:16.340 --> 01:21:18.500
face of the serpent, able to send

2226
01:21:18.500 --> 01:21:19.920
him back to his place.

2227
01:21:19.920 --> 01:21:22.300
Came they to man and taught him

2228
01:21:22.300 --> 01:21:24.960
the secret, the word, that only a

2229
01:21:24.960 --> 01:21:26.020
man can pronounce.

2230
01:21:26.500 --> 01:21:28.720
Swift then they lifted the veil from

2231
01:21:28.720 --> 01:21:30.760
the serpent and cast him forth from

2232
01:21:30.760 --> 01:21:31.960
the place among men.

2233
01:21:33.860 --> 01:21:36.620
Yet beware, the serpent still liveth

2234
01:21:36.620 --> 01:21:38.420
in a place that is open at

2235
01:21:38.420 --> 01:21:39.620
times to the world.

2236
01:21:40.180 --> 01:21:42.820
Unseen they walk among thee in places

2237
01:21:42.820 --> 01:21:44.520
where the rites have been said.

2238
01:21:45.100 --> 01:21:47.340
Again, as time passes onward, shall

2239
01:21:47.340 --> 01:21:49.120
they take the semblance of men.

2240
01:21:49.920 --> 01:21:51.900
Called may they be by the master

2241
01:21:51.900 --> 01:21:53.740
who knows the white or the black,

2242
01:21:53.880 --> 01:21:55.980
but only the white master may control

2243
01:21:55.980 --> 01:21:57.660
and bind them while in the flesh.

2244
01:21:58.440 --> 01:22:00.620
Seek not the kingdom of shadows, for

2245
01:22:00.620 --> 01:22:02.080
evil will surely appear.

2246
01:22:02.540 --> 01:22:04.100
For only the master of brightness

2247
01:22:04.100 --> 01:22:06.160
shall conquer the shadow of fear.

2248
01:22:06.960 --> 01:22:09.280
Know ye, O my brother, that fear

2249
01:22:09.280 --> 01:22:10.740
is an obstacle great.

2250
01:22:11.140 --> 01:22:13.040
Be master of all in the brightness.

2251
01:22:13.600 --> 01:22:15.140
The shadow will soon disappear.

2252
01:22:15.780 --> 01:22:17.540
Hear ye and heed my wisdom.

2253
01:22:17.820 --> 01:22:19.700
The voice of light is clear.

2254
01:22:20.360 --> 01:22:22.680
Seek not the valley of shadow, and

2255
01:22:22.680 --> 01:22:24.240
light will only appear.

2256
01:22:25.680 --> 01:22:27.660
List ye, O man, to the depth

2257
01:22:27.660 --> 01:22:28.400
of my wisdom.

2258
01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:31.340
Speak I of knowledge hidden from man.

2259
01:22:32.180 --> 01:22:33.880
Far have I been on my journey

2260
01:22:33.880 --> 01:22:36.220
through space-time, even to the end

2261
01:22:36.220 --> 01:22:37.540
of space of this cycle.

2262
01:22:38.260 --> 01:22:40.660
I glipsed the hounds of the barrier,

2263
01:22:41.100 --> 01:22:42.640
lying in wait for he who would

2264
01:22:42.640 --> 01:22:43.280
pass them.

2265
01:22:43.790 --> 01:22:46.060
In that space where time exists not,

2266
01:22:46.220 --> 01:22:48.440
faintly I sensed the guardians of cycles.

2267
01:22:49.180 --> 01:22:50.680
Move they only through angles.

2268
01:22:51.300 --> 01:22:53.400
Free are they not of the curved dimensions.

2269
01:22:54.220 --> 01:22:55.860
Strange and terrible are the hounds

2270
01:22:55.860 --> 01:22:56.540
of the barrier.

2271
01:22:57.420 --> 01:22:59.200
Follow they consciousness to the limits

2272
01:22:59.200 --> 01:22:59.900
of space.

2273
01:23:00.580 --> 01:23:02.500
Think not to escape by entering your

2274
01:23:02.500 --> 01:23:05.100
body, for follow they fast the soul

2275
01:23:05.100 --> 01:23:05.820
through angles.

2276
01:23:06.500 --> 01:23:08.360
Only the circle will give ye protection,

2277
01:23:09.280 --> 01:23:11.080
save from the claws of the dwellers

2278
01:23:11.080 --> 01:23:11.640
in angles.

2279
01:23:12.900 --> 01:23:15.380
Once, in a time past, I approached

2280
01:23:15.380 --> 01:23:17.260
the great barrier, and saw on the

2281
01:23:17.260 --> 01:23:18.120
shores where time

2282
01:23:18.120 --> 01:23:20.700
exists not, the formless forms of

2283
01:23:20.700 --> 01:23:21.800
the hounds of the barrier.

2284
01:23:22.640 --> 01:23:25.040
I, hiding in the midst beyond time,

2285
01:23:25.140 --> 01:23:27.460
I found them, and they, senting me

2286
01:23:27.460 --> 01:23:28.680
afar off, raised

2287
01:23:28.680 --> 01:23:30.560
themselves and gave the great bell

2288
01:23:30.560 --> 01:23:32.600
cry that could be heard from cycle

2289
01:23:32.600 --> 01:23:34.100
to cycle, and moved

2290
01:23:34.100 --> 01:23:36.000
through space toward my soul.

2291
01:23:36.820 --> 01:23:39.260
Fled I then fast before them, back

2292
01:23:39.260 --> 01:23:40.880
from time's unthinkable end.

2293
01:23:40.880 --> 01:23:43.320
But ever after me pursued they, moving

2294
01:23:43.320 --> 01:23:45.440
in strange angles not known to man.

2295
01:23:46.040 --> 01:23:48.060
I, on the gray shores of time's

2296
01:23:48.060 --> 01:23:50.520
space's end, found I the hounds of

2297
01:23:50.520 --> 01:23:51.080
the barrier,

2298
01:23:51.720 --> 01:23:54.080
ravening for the soul who attempts

2299
01:23:54.080 --> 01:23:54.860
thee beyond.

2300
01:23:55.600 --> 01:23:57.940
Fled I through circles back to my body.

2301
01:23:58.500 --> 01:24:00.540
Fled, and fast after me they followed.

2302
01:24:01.140 --> 01:24:03.660
I, after me the devourers followed,

2303
01:24:04.100 --> 01:24:06.500
seeking through angles to devour my soul.

2304
01:24:07.220 --> 01:24:09.700
I know, ye men, that the soul

2305
01:24:09.700 --> 01:24:11.740
who dares the barrier may be held

2306
01:24:11.740 --> 01:24:13.120
in bondage by the hounds

2307
01:24:13.120 --> 01:24:16.160
from beyond time, held till this cycle

2308
01:24:16.160 --> 01:24:18.520
is completed and left behind when

2309
01:24:18.520 --> 01:24:19.140
the consciousness

2310
01:24:19.140 --> 01:24:19.840
leaves.

2311
01:24:21.740 --> 01:24:24.620
Entered I my body, created the circles

2312
01:24:24.620 --> 01:24:26.800
that know not angles, created the

2313
01:24:26.800 --> 01:24:27.580
form that from

2314
01:24:27.580 --> 01:24:30.420
my form was formed, made my body

2315
01:24:30.420 --> 01:24:32.760
into a circle and lost the pursuers

2316
01:24:32.760 --> 01:24:34.180
in the circles of time.

2317
01:24:34.180 --> 01:24:37.180
But even yet, when free from my

2318
01:24:37.180 --> 01:24:39.560
body, cautious ever must I be not

2319
01:24:39.560 --> 01:24:40.640
to move through angles,

2320
01:24:41.080 --> 01:24:43.080
else my soul may never be free.

2321
01:24:44.140 --> 01:24:45.880
Know ye the hounds of the barrier

2322
01:24:45.880 --> 01:24:47.680
move only through angles and never

2323
01:24:47.680 --> 01:24:48.560
through curves of

2324
01:24:48.560 --> 01:24:49.020
space.

2325
01:24:49.640 --> 01:24:51.340
Only by moving through curves can

2326
01:24:51.340 --> 01:24:53.760
ye escape them, for in angles they

2327
01:24:53.760 --> 01:24:54.700
will pursue thee.

2328
01:24:55.840 --> 01:24:57.680
O man, heed ye my warning.

2329
01:24:58.260 --> 01:25:00.060
Seek not the break open the gate

2330
01:25:00.060 --> 01:25:00.800
to the beyond.

2331
01:25:01.440 --> 01:25:03.600
Few there are who have succeeded in

2332
01:25:03.600 --> 01:25:05.300
passing the barrier to the greater

2333
01:25:05.300 --> 01:25:06.240
light that shines

2334
01:25:06.240 --> 01:25:06.800
beyond.

2335
01:25:07.280 --> 01:25:10.060
For know ye, ever the dwellers seek

2336
01:25:10.060 --> 01:25:12.280
such souls to hold in their thrall.

2337
01:25:13.600 --> 01:25:16.060
Listen, O man, and heed ye my warning.

2338
01:25:16.560 --> 01:25:18.360
Seek ye to move not in angles

2339
01:25:18.360 --> 01:25:20.880
but curves, and if while free from

2340
01:25:20.880 --> 01:25:22.920
thy body thou hearest the

2341
01:25:22.920 --> 01:25:24.740
sound like the bay of a hound

2342
01:25:24.740 --> 01:25:26.800
ringing clear and bell-like through

2343
01:25:26.800 --> 01:25:28.520
thy being, flee back

2344
01:25:28.520 --> 01:25:30.000
to thy body through circles.

2345
01:25:30.320 --> 01:25:32.300
Penetrate not the mist before.

2346
01:25:33.060 --> 01:25:34.980
When thou hath entered the form thou

2347
01:25:34.980 --> 01:25:37.560
hast dwelt in, use thou the cross

2348
01:25:37.560 --> 01:25:38.340
and the circle

2349
01:25:38.340 --> 01:25:38.900
combined.

2350
01:25:39.540 --> 01:25:42.240
Open thy mouth, and use thou thy voice.

2351
01:25:42.940 --> 01:25:45.180
Utter the word, and thou shalt be free.

2352
01:25:45.800 --> 01:25:48.020
Only the one who of light has

2353
01:25:48.020 --> 01:25:50.020
the fullest can hope to pass by

2354
01:25:50.020 --> 01:25:51.120
the guards of the way.

2355
01:25:51.680 --> 01:25:53.820
And then must he move through strange

2356
01:25:53.820 --> 01:25:55.500
curves and angles that are formed

2357
01:25:55.500 --> 01:25:56.480
in direction not

2358
01:25:56.480 --> 01:25:57.240
known to man.

2359
01:25:57.820 --> 01:25:59.660
List ye, O man, and heed ye

2360
01:25:59.660 --> 01:26:00.240
my warning.

2361
01:26:00.640 --> 01:26:02.540
Attempt not to pass the guards on

2362
01:26:02.540 --> 01:26:02.940
the way.

2363
01:26:03.460 --> 01:26:05.300
Rather should ye seek to gain of

2364
01:26:05.300 --> 01:26:07.440
thine own light, and make thyself

2365
01:26:07.440 --> 01:26:08.620
ready to pass on the

2366
01:26:08.620 --> 01:26:08.880
way.

2367
01:26:09.540 --> 01:26:12.220
Light is thine ultimate end, O my brother.

2368
01:26:12.800 --> 01:26:15.020
Seek and find ever the light on

2369
01:26:15.020 --> 01:26:15.420
the way.

2370
01:26:22.020 --> 01:26:24.660
List ye, O man, hear ye my voice.

2371
01:26:24.660 --> 01:26:27.340
Teaching of wisdom and light in this cycle.

2372
01:26:27.660 --> 01:26:29.840
Teaching ye how to banish the darkness.

2373
01:26:30.160 --> 01:26:32.060
Teaching ye how to bring light in

2374
01:26:32.060 --> 01:26:32.740
thy life.

2375
01:26:33.780 --> 01:26:35.340
Seek ye, O man, to find the

2376
01:26:35.340 --> 01:26:37.380
great pathway that leads to eternal

2377
01:26:37.380 --> 01:26:38.540
life as a sun.

2378
01:26:39.220 --> 01:26:41.120
Draw ye away from the veil of

2379
01:26:41.120 --> 01:26:41.600
the darkness.

2380
01:26:42.460 --> 01:26:44.480
Seek to become a light in the world.

2381
01:26:45.180 --> 01:26:47.320
Make of thyself a vessel for light.

2382
01:26:47.740 --> 01:26:50.100
A focus for the sun of this space.

2383
01:26:50.920 --> 01:26:52.940
Lift thou thine eyes to the cosmos.

2384
01:26:53.660 --> 01:26:55.760
Lift thou thine eyes to the light.

2385
01:26:56.340 --> 01:26:58.500
Speak in the words of the dweller,

2386
01:26:58.580 --> 01:27:00.560
the chant that calls down the light.

2387
01:27:01.180 --> 01:27:02.780
Sing thou the song of freedom.

2388
01:27:03.300 --> 01:27:05.120
Sing thou the song of the soul.

2389
01:27:05.720 --> 01:27:07.620
Create the high vibration that will

2390
01:27:07.620 --> 01:27:09.240
make thee one with the whole.

2391
01:27:09.900 --> 01:27:11.900
Blend all thyself with the cosmos.

2392
01:27:12.640 --> 01:27:14.320
Grow into one with the light.

2393
01:27:14.960 --> 01:27:17.280
Be thou a channel of order, a

2394
01:27:17.280 --> 01:27:19.220
pathway of law to the world.

2395
01:27:19.960 --> 01:27:22.500
Thy light, O man, is the great light.

2396
01:27:23.060 --> 01:27:25.020
Shining through the shadow of flesh.

2397
01:27:25.960 --> 01:27:28.000
Free must thou rise from the darkness

2398
01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:30.120
before thou art one with the light.

2399
01:27:30.920 --> 01:27:32.760
Shadows of darkness surround thee.

2400
01:27:33.200 --> 01:27:35.020
Life fills thee with its flow.

2401
01:27:35.660 --> 01:27:37.800
But no, O man, thou must arise

2402
01:27:37.800 --> 01:27:39.640
and forth thy body go far to

2403
01:27:39.640 --> 01:27:41.200
the planes that surround thee

2404
01:27:41.200 --> 01:27:43.280
and yet are one with thee too.

2405
01:27:44.180 --> 01:27:45.700
Look all around thee, O man.

2406
01:27:46.240 --> 01:27:47.920
See thine own light reflected.

2407
01:27:48.480 --> 01:27:50.640
Ay, even in the darkness around thee,

2408
01:27:50.800 --> 01:27:52.660
thine own light pours forth through

2409
01:27:52.660 --> 01:27:53.120
the veil.

2410
01:27:53.820 --> 01:27:55.500
Seek thou for wisdom always.

2411
01:27:56.080 --> 01:27:57.780
Let not thine body betray.

2412
01:27:58.400 --> 01:28:00.160
Keep in the path of the light wave.

2413
01:28:00.560 --> 01:28:02.120
Shun thou the darkened way.

2414
01:28:02.660 --> 01:28:04.400
Know thee that wisdom is lasting,

2415
01:28:04.980 --> 01:28:07.060
existing since the all-soul began,

2416
01:28:07.520 --> 01:28:09.600
creating harmony from by the law that

2417
01:28:09.600 --> 01:28:10.700
exists in the way.

2418
01:28:12.560 --> 01:28:14.140
List ye, O man, to the teachings

2419
01:28:14.140 --> 01:28:14.860
of wisdom.

2420
01:28:14.860 --> 01:28:17.120
List to the voice that speaks of

2421
01:28:17.120 --> 01:28:17.940
the pastime.

2422
01:28:18.480 --> 01:28:21.160
Ay, I shall tell thee knowledge forbidden.

2423
01:28:21.680 --> 01:28:23.980
Tell ye of wisdom hidden in pastime,

2424
01:28:24.420 --> 01:28:26.820
lost in the midst of darkness around me.

2425
01:28:27.640 --> 01:28:29.140
Know ye, O man, ye are the

2426
01:28:29.140 --> 01:28:30.520
ultimate of all things.

2427
01:28:30.920 --> 01:28:32.760
Only the knowledge of this is forgotten.

2428
01:28:33.380 --> 01:28:35.640
Lost when man was cast into bondage,

2429
01:28:35.780 --> 01:28:37.660
bound and fettered by the chains of

2430
01:28:37.660 --> 01:28:38.120
the darkness.

2431
01:28:39.220 --> 01:28:41.640
Long, long ago I cast off my body.

2432
01:28:41.640 --> 01:28:43.960
Wandered I free through the vastness

2433
01:28:43.960 --> 01:28:46.340
of ether, circled the angels that

2434
01:28:46.340 --> 01:28:47.680
hold man in bondage.

2435
01:28:48.140 --> 01:28:49.760
Know ye, O man, ye are only

2436
01:28:49.760 --> 01:28:50.460
a spirit.

2437
01:28:50.900 --> 01:28:51.920
The body is nothing.

2438
01:28:52.380 --> 01:28:53.540
The soul is all.

2439
01:28:54.080 --> 01:28:55.780
Let not your body be a fetter.

2440
01:28:56.280 --> 01:28:58.740
Cast off the darkness and travel in light.

2441
01:28:59.220 --> 01:29:00.820
Cast off your body, O man, and

2442
01:29:00.820 --> 01:29:02.760
be free, truly a light that is

2443
01:29:02.760 --> 01:29:03.880
one with the light.

2444
01:29:04.640 --> 01:29:06.320
When ye are free from the fetters

2445
01:29:06.320 --> 01:29:08.920
of darkness and travel in space as

2446
01:29:08.920 --> 01:29:10.000
the sun of the light,

2447
01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:12.240
then ye shall know that space is

2448
01:29:12.240 --> 01:29:14.640
not boundless, but truly bounded by

2449
01:29:14.640 --> 01:29:15.880
angles and curves.

2450
01:29:16.540 --> 01:29:18.420
Know ye, O man, that all that

2451
01:29:18.420 --> 01:29:20.500
exists is only an aspect of greater

2452
01:29:20.500 --> 01:29:21.700
things yet to come.

2453
01:29:22.280 --> 01:29:24.200
Matter is fluid and flows like a

2454
01:29:24.200 --> 01:29:26.600
stream, constantly changing from one

2455
01:29:26.600 --> 01:29:27.440
thing to another.

2456
01:29:28.280 --> 01:29:29.980
All through the ages has knowledge

2457
01:29:29.980 --> 01:29:32.180
existed, never been changed,

2458
01:29:32.580 --> 01:29:34.620
though buried in darkness, never been

2459
01:29:34.620 --> 01:29:36.580
lost, though forgotten by man.

2460
01:29:37.400 --> 01:29:39.240
Know ye that throughout the space

2461
01:29:39.240 --> 01:29:41.100
that ye dwell in are others as

2462
01:29:41.100 --> 01:29:42.140
great as your own,

2463
01:29:42.560 --> 01:29:44.300
interlaced through the heart of your

2464
01:29:44.300 --> 01:29:46.860
matter, yet separate in space of their own.

2465
01:29:48.160 --> 01:29:50.800
Once in a time long forgotten, I,

2466
01:29:51.120 --> 01:29:53.420
Thoth, opened the doorway, penetrated

2467
01:29:53.420 --> 01:29:54.620
into other spaces,

2468
01:29:54.820 --> 01:29:56.640
and learned of the secrets concealed.

2469
01:29:57.260 --> 01:29:59.040
Deep in the essence of matter are

2470
01:29:59.040 --> 01:30:00.640
many mysteries concealed.

2471
01:30:01.300 --> 01:30:03.200
Nine are the interlocked dimensions,

2472
01:30:03.460 --> 01:30:05.300
and nine are the cycles of space.

2473
01:30:05.300 --> 01:30:07.920
Nine are the diffusions of consciousness,

2474
01:30:08.200 --> 01:30:10.260
and nine are the worlds within worlds.

2475
01:30:10.720 --> 01:30:13.060
I, nine are the lords of the

2476
01:30:13.060 --> 01:30:15.280
cycles that come from above and below.

2477
01:30:16.160 --> 01:30:18.520
Space is filled with concealed ones,

2478
01:30:18.680 --> 01:30:20.660
for space is divided by time.

2479
01:30:21.260 --> 01:30:22.940
Seek ye the key to the time

2480
01:30:22.940 --> 01:30:25.580
-space, and ye shall unlock the gate.

2481
01:30:26.160 --> 01:30:28.280
Know ye that throughout the time-space

2482
01:30:28.280 --> 01:30:30.140
consciousness surely exists,

2483
01:30:30.660 --> 01:30:32.460
though from our knowledge it is hidden,

2484
01:30:32.820 --> 01:30:34.460
yet still forever exists.

2485
01:30:35.020 --> 01:30:37.100
The key to worlds within thee are

2486
01:30:37.100 --> 01:30:38.240
found only within,

2487
01:30:38.900 --> 01:30:40.780
for man is the gateway of mystery,

2488
01:30:41.220 --> 01:30:42.680
and the key that is one with

2489
01:30:42.680 --> 01:30:43.180
the One.

2490
01:30:44.140 --> 01:30:46.620
Seek ye within the circle. Use the

2491
01:30:46.620 --> 01:30:47.800
word I shall give.

2492
01:30:48.300 --> 01:30:50.140
Open the gateway within thee, and

2493
01:30:50.140 --> 01:30:52.140
surely thou too shall live.

2494
01:30:52.800 --> 01:30:55.500
Man, ye think that ye liveth, but

2495
01:30:55.500 --> 01:30:57.300
know it is life within death.

2496
01:30:57.780 --> 01:30:59.260
For as sure as ye are bound

2497
01:30:59.260 --> 01:31:01.900
to your body, for you no life exists.

2498
01:31:01.900 --> 01:31:05.060
Only the soul is space-free, has

2499
01:31:05.060 --> 01:31:06.660
life that is really a life.

2500
01:31:07.160 --> 01:31:09.140
All else is only a bondage, a

2501
01:31:09.140 --> 01:31:10.580
fetter from which to be free.

2502
01:31:11.460 --> 01:31:13.680
Think not that man is earth-born,

2503
01:31:14.220 --> 01:31:16.020
though come from the earth he may be.

2504
01:31:16.620 --> 01:31:19.260
Man is light-born spirit, but without

2505
01:31:19.260 --> 01:31:21.200
knowing he can never be free.

2506
01:31:21.940 --> 01:31:23.660
Darkness surrounds the light-born.

2507
01:31:24.200 --> 01:31:25.800
Darkness fetters the soul.

2508
01:31:26.400 --> 01:31:28.080
Only the one who is seeking may

2509
01:31:28.080 --> 01:31:29.400
ever hope to be free.

2510
01:31:30.720 --> 01:31:33.500
Shadows around thee are falling. Darkness

2511
01:31:33.500 --> 01:31:35.120
fills all the spaces.

2512
01:31:35.680 --> 01:31:37.480
Shine forth, O light of the man

2513
01:31:37.480 --> 01:31:40.420
-soul. Fill thou the darkness of space.

2514
01:31:41.140 --> 01:31:42.540
Ye are a sun of the great

2515
01:31:42.540 --> 01:31:45.240
light. Remember, and ye shall be free.

2516
01:31:45.920 --> 01:31:48.560
Stay not thou in the shadows. Spring

2517
01:31:48.560 --> 01:31:50.240
forth from the darkness of night.

2518
01:31:50.980 --> 01:31:53.880
Light, let thy soul be, O sun

2519
01:31:53.880 --> 01:31:55.740
-born, filled with glory of light,

2520
01:31:55.740 --> 01:31:57.880
freed from the bonds of darkness,

2521
01:31:58.340 --> 01:32:00.200
a soul that is one with the light.

2522
01:32:00.880 --> 01:32:02.960
Thou art the key to all wisdom.

2523
01:32:03.760 --> 01:32:05.960
Within thee is all time and space.

2524
01:32:06.580 --> 01:32:09.220
Live not in bondage to darkness. Free

2525
01:32:09.220 --> 01:32:11.180
thou thy light-form from night.

2526
01:32:12.300 --> 01:32:14.760
Great light that fills all the cosmos,

2527
01:32:15.020 --> 01:32:16.520
flow thou fully to man.

2528
01:32:17.060 --> 01:32:18.800
Make of his body a light-torch

2529
01:32:18.800 --> 01:32:20.840
that shall never be quenched among men.

2530
01:32:21.520 --> 01:32:23.680
Long in the past sought I wisdom,

2531
01:32:24.360 --> 01:32:25.820
knowledge not known to man.

2532
01:32:26.640 --> 01:32:28.380
Far to the past I traveled into

2533
01:32:28.380 --> 01:32:29.860
the space where time began.

2534
01:32:30.780 --> 01:32:32.540
Sought I ever new knowledge to add

2535
01:32:32.540 --> 01:32:33.660
to the wisdom I know.

2536
01:32:34.140 --> 01:32:36.260
Yet only I found did the future

2537
01:32:36.260 --> 01:32:38.000
hold the key to wisdom I sought.

2538
01:32:39.360 --> 01:32:41.440
Down to the halls of Amenti I

2539
01:32:41.440 --> 01:32:43.860
journeyed, the greater knowledge to seek.

2540
01:32:44.500 --> 01:32:46.160
Ask of the lords of the cycles

2541
01:32:46.160 --> 01:32:47.800
the way to wisdom I sought.

2542
01:32:48.520 --> 01:32:50.540
Ask the lords this question.

2543
01:32:51.400 --> 01:32:53.640
Where is the source of all?

2544
01:32:54.740 --> 01:32:56.660
Answered in tones that were mighty

2545
01:32:56.660 --> 01:32:58.460
the voice of the lord of the nine.

2546
01:32:58.980 --> 01:33:01.640
Free thou thy soul from thy body

2547
01:33:01.640 --> 01:33:03.680
and come forth with me to the light.

2548
01:33:04.780 --> 01:33:06.760
Forth I came from my body, a

2549
01:33:06.760 --> 01:33:08.240
glittering flame in the night.

2550
01:33:08.880 --> 01:33:10.660
Stood I before the lords bathed in

2551
01:33:10.660 --> 01:33:11.740
the fire of life.

2552
01:33:12.480 --> 01:33:14.260
Seized was I then by a force

2553
01:33:14.260 --> 01:33:16.080
great beyond knowledge of man.

2554
01:33:16.700 --> 01:33:18.500
Cast was I to the abyss through

2555
01:33:18.500 --> 01:33:20.200
spaces unknown to man.

2556
01:33:20.840 --> 01:33:23.500
Saw I molding of order from the

2557
01:33:23.500 --> 01:33:25.160
chaos and angles of night.

2558
01:33:25.600 --> 01:33:27.740
Saw I the light spring from order

2559
01:33:27.740 --> 01:33:29.440
and heard the voice of the light.

2560
01:33:30.220 --> 01:33:31.860
Saw I the flame of the abyss,

2561
01:33:32.360 --> 01:33:34.020
casting forth order and light.

2562
01:33:34.580 --> 01:33:36.500
Saw order spring out of chaos.

2563
01:33:36.960 --> 01:33:39.040
Saw light giving forth life.

2564
01:33:40.100 --> 01:33:41.440
Then heard I the voice.

2565
01:33:42.260 --> 01:33:44.940
Hear thou and understand, the flame

2566
01:33:44.940 --> 01:33:47.000
is the source of all things,

2567
01:33:47.160 --> 01:33:49.520
containing all things in potentiality.

2568
01:33:50.020 --> 01:33:52.240
The order that set forth light is

2569
01:33:52.240 --> 01:33:52.800
the word,

2570
01:33:53.180 --> 01:33:54.900
and from the word comes from life

2571
01:33:54.900 --> 01:33:56.260
and the existence of all.

2572
01:33:56.700 --> 01:33:58.740
And again spoke the voice, saying,

2573
01:33:59.480 --> 01:34:01.500
The life in thee is the word.

2574
01:34:02.120 --> 01:34:04.260
Find thou the life within thee and

2575
01:34:04.260 --> 01:34:06.360
have powers to use of the word.

2576
01:34:07.080 --> 01:34:09.160
Long I watched the light flame pouring

2577
01:34:09.160 --> 01:34:10.980
forth from the essence of fire,

2578
01:34:11.420 --> 01:34:14.020
realizing that life is but order and

2579
01:34:14.020 --> 01:34:16.020
that man is one with the fire.

2580
01:34:18.200 --> 01:34:20.820
Back I came to my body, stood

2581
01:34:20.820 --> 01:34:21.980
again with the nine,

2582
01:34:22.260 --> 01:34:24.060
listened to the voice of the cycles,

2583
01:34:24.320 --> 01:34:26.360
vibrate with powers they spoke.

2584
01:34:27.260 --> 01:34:29.180
Know ye, O Thoth, that life is

2585
01:34:29.180 --> 01:34:30.480
but the word of the fire.

2586
01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:33.100
The life force ye seek before thee

2587
01:34:33.100 --> 01:34:34.740
is but the word in the world

2588
01:34:34.740 --> 01:34:35.600
as a fire.

2589
01:34:36.260 --> 01:34:37.860
Seek ye the path to the word

2590
01:34:37.860 --> 01:34:40.160
and powers shall surely be thine.

2591
01:34:40.900 --> 01:34:43.220
Then ask I of the nine, O

2592
01:34:43.220 --> 01:34:44.540
Lord, show me the path.

2593
01:34:44.540 --> 01:34:46.780
Give me the path to the wisdom.

2594
01:34:47.400 --> 01:34:49.100
Show me the way to the word,

2595
01:34:49.520 --> 01:34:51.380
answered me then the Lord of the nine.

2596
01:34:52.240 --> 01:34:54.180
Through order ye shall find the way.

2597
01:34:55.040 --> 01:34:57.060
Saw ye not that the word came

2598
01:34:57.060 --> 01:34:57.900
from chaos?

2599
01:34:58.500 --> 01:35:01.380
Saw ye not that light came from fire?

2600
01:35:02.020 --> 01:35:04.100
Look in thy life for disorder.

2601
01:35:04.640 --> 01:35:06.300
Balance and order thy life.

2602
01:35:06.960 --> 01:35:09.300
Quill all the chaos of emotions, and

2603
01:35:09.300 --> 01:35:11.160
thou shalt have order in life.

2604
01:35:11.800 --> 01:35:14.040
Order brought forth from chaos will

2605
01:35:14.040 --> 01:35:15.900
bring thee the word of the source.

2606
01:35:16.660 --> 01:35:19.060
Give thee the power of cycles, and

2607
01:35:19.060 --> 01:35:20.640
make of thy soul a force

2608
01:35:20.640 --> 01:35:22.560
that free will extend through the

2609
01:35:22.560 --> 01:35:25.440
ages a perfected sun from the source.

2610
01:35:26.260 --> 01:35:28.800
Listened I to the voice, and deep

2611
01:35:28.800 --> 01:35:30.540
sank the words in my heart.

2612
01:35:31.140 --> 01:35:33.220
Forever have I sought for order that

2613
01:35:33.220 --> 01:35:34.580
I might draw on the word.

2614
01:35:35.200 --> 01:35:37.100
Know ye that he who attains it

2615
01:35:37.100 --> 01:35:38.600
must ever in order be.

2616
01:35:39.120 --> 01:35:41.240
For use of the word through disorder

2617
01:35:41.240 --> 01:35:43.040
has never and can never be.

2618
01:35:43.840 --> 01:35:45.360
Take ye these words, O man.

2619
01:35:45.760 --> 01:35:48.040
As part of thy life, let them be.

2620
01:35:48.720 --> 01:35:50.680
Seek thee to conquer disorder, and

2621
01:35:50.680 --> 01:35:53.060
one with the word thou shalt be.

2622
01:35:53.700 --> 01:35:55.980
Put forth thy effort in gaining light

2623
01:35:55.980 --> 01:35:57.300
on the pathway of life.

2624
01:35:57.940 --> 01:36:00.000
Seek to be one with the sun state.

2625
01:36:00.680 --> 01:36:02.180
Seek to be solely the light.

2626
01:36:02.880 --> 01:36:05.340
Hold thou thy thought on the oneness

2627
01:36:05.340 --> 01:36:07.100
of light with the body of man.

2628
01:36:07.100 --> 01:36:10.120
Know that all is order from chaos

2629
01:36:10.120 --> 01:36:11.540
born into light.

2630
01:36:19.240 --> 01:36:21.800
List ye, O man, take of my wisdom.

2631
01:36:22.240 --> 01:36:23.740
Learn of the deep hidden mysteries

2632
01:36:23.740 --> 01:36:24.500
of space.

2633
01:36:25.320 --> 01:36:26.840
Learn of the thought that grew in

2634
01:36:26.840 --> 01:36:29.300
the abyss, bringing order and harmony

2635
01:36:29.300 --> 01:36:30.200
in space.

2636
01:36:31.040 --> 01:36:33.200
Know ye, O man, that all exist

2637
01:36:33.200 --> 01:36:35.200
has being only because of the law.

2638
01:36:35.200 --> 01:36:37.460
Know ye the law, and ye shall

2639
01:36:37.460 --> 01:36:38.000
be free.

2640
01:36:38.300 --> 01:36:40.260
Never be bound by the fetters of night.

2641
01:36:41.100 --> 01:36:43.440
Far through strange spaces have I

2642
01:36:43.440 --> 01:36:45.060
journeyed into the deep of the abyss

2643
01:36:45.060 --> 01:36:45.620
of time,

2644
01:36:45.880 --> 01:36:48.000
learning strange and yet stranger

2645
01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:51.020
mysteries, until in the end all was revealed.

2646
01:36:51.860 --> 01:36:53.760
Know ye that mystery is only mystery

2647
01:36:53.760 --> 01:36:55.780
when it is knowledge unknown to man.

2648
01:36:56.540 --> 01:36:58.200
When ye have plumbed the heart of

2649
01:36:58.200 --> 01:37:00.340
all mystery, knowledge and wisdom

2650
01:37:00.340 --> 01:37:01.660
will surely be thine.

2651
01:37:02.300 --> 01:37:04.540
Seek ye, and learn that time is

2652
01:37:04.540 --> 01:37:06.720
the secret whereby ye may be free

2653
01:37:06.720 --> 01:37:07.700
of this space.

2654
01:37:09.280 --> 01:37:11.740
Long have I, Thoth, sought wisdom.

2655
01:37:12.320 --> 01:37:14.860
I, and shall seek of eternities end,

2656
01:37:15.040 --> 01:37:17.080
for know that ever before me receding

2657
01:37:17.080 --> 01:37:19.260
shall move the goal I seek to attain.

2658
01:37:20.020 --> 01:37:22.020
Even the lords of the cycles know

2659
01:37:22.020 --> 01:37:24.020
that not yet have they reached the goal,

2660
01:37:24.400 --> 01:37:26.300
for with all of their wisdom they

2661
01:37:26.300 --> 01:37:27.720
know that truth ever grows.

2662
01:37:28.380 --> 01:37:30.480
Once in a pastime I spoke to

2663
01:37:30.480 --> 01:37:32.680
the dweller, asked of the mystery

2664
01:37:32.680 --> 01:37:33.900
of time and space,

2665
01:37:34.420 --> 01:37:36.720
asked him to question the surged in

2666
01:37:36.720 --> 01:37:40.520
my being, saying, O master, what is time?

2667
01:37:41.300 --> 01:37:43.240
Then to me spoke he, the master,

2668
01:37:43.960 --> 01:37:45.480
Know ye, O Thoth, in the beginning

2669
01:37:45.480 --> 01:37:47.220
there was void and nothingness,

2670
01:37:47.680 --> 01:37:50.200
a timeless, spaceless nothingness.

2671
01:37:50.680 --> 01:37:52.960
And into the nothingness came a thought,

2672
01:37:53.460 --> 01:37:55.020
purposeful, all-pervading,

2673
01:37:55.600 --> 01:37:56.680
and it filled the void.

2674
01:37:57.240 --> 01:37:59.920
There existed no matter, only force,

2675
01:38:00.060 --> 01:38:00.580
a movement,

2676
01:38:00.800 --> 01:38:03.200
a vortex, or vibration of the purposeful

2677
01:38:03.200 --> 01:38:04.760
thought that filled the void.

2678
01:38:06.200 --> 01:38:08.760
And I questioned the master, saying,

2679
01:38:09.260 --> 01:38:11.000
Was this thought eternal?

2680
01:38:11.380 --> 01:38:13.660
And answered me the dweller, saying,

2681
01:38:14.200 --> 01:38:16.680
In the beginning there was eternal thought,

2682
01:38:16.980 --> 01:38:18.860
and for thought to be eternal, time

2683
01:38:18.860 --> 01:38:19.580
must exist.

2684
01:38:20.140 --> 01:38:22.040
So into the all-pervading thought

2685
01:38:22.040 --> 01:38:23.340
grew the law of time.

2686
01:38:23.980 --> 01:38:26.360
Ay, time which exists through all

2687
01:38:26.360 --> 01:38:29.380
space, floating in a smooth, rhythmic movement,

2688
01:38:29.880 --> 01:38:32.480
that is eternally in a state of fixation.

2689
01:38:33.180 --> 01:38:35.820
Time changes not, but all things change

2690
01:38:35.820 --> 01:38:36.360
in time,

2691
01:38:36.760 --> 01:38:38.480
for time is the force that holds

2692
01:38:38.480 --> 01:38:41.640
events separate, each in its own proper place.

2693
01:38:42.320 --> 01:38:44.500
Time is not in motion, but ye

2694
01:38:44.500 --> 01:38:45.520
move through time

2695
01:38:45.520 --> 01:38:47.440
as your consciousness moves from one

2696
01:38:47.440 --> 01:38:48.260
event to another.

2697
01:38:49.060 --> 01:38:51.820
Ay, by time yet exist all in

2698
01:38:51.820 --> 01:38:54.040
all, all eternal one existence.

2699
01:38:55.260 --> 01:38:56.840
Know ye that even though in the

2700
01:38:56.840 --> 01:38:57.920
time ye are separate,

2701
01:38:58.140 --> 01:39:01.380
ye still are one, in all times existent.

2702
01:39:02.400 --> 01:39:04.300
Ceased then the voice of the dweller,

2703
01:39:04.820 --> 01:39:06.860
and departed I to ponder on time,

2704
01:39:07.380 --> 01:39:09.160
for knew I that in these words

2705
01:39:09.160 --> 01:39:11.580
lay wisdom, and a way to explore

2706
01:39:11.580 --> 01:39:12.840
the mysteries of time.

2707
01:39:14.260 --> 01:39:15.960
Oft did I ponder the words of

2708
01:39:15.960 --> 01:39:16.380
the dweller,

2709
01:39:16.380 --> 01:39:18.820
then sought I to solve the mystery

2710
01:39:18.820 --> 01:39:21.460
of time, found I that time moves

2711
01:39:21.460 --> 01:39:22.760
through strange angles,

2712
01:39:23.460 --> 01:39:25.220
yet only by curves could I hope

2713
01:39:25.220 --> 01:39:26.740
to attain the key that would give

2714
01:39:26.740 --> 01:39:28.580
me access to the time-space.

2715
01:39:29.380 --> 01:39:31.560
Found I that only by moving upward,

2716
01:39:32.120 --> 01:39:34.240
and yet again by moving to rightward,

2717
01:39:34.460 --> 01:39:36.040
could I be free from the time

2718
01:39:36.040 --> 01:39:36.700
of the movement.

2719
01:39:37.660 --> 01:39:39.040
Forth I came from out of my

2720
01:39:39.040 --> 01:39:40.680
body, moved in the movements that

2721
01:39:40.680 --> 01:39:41.780
changed me in time.

2722
01:39:42.460 --> 01:39:44.120
Strange were the sights I saw in

2723
01:39:44.120 --> 01:39:44.640
my journeys,

2724
01:39:45.280 --> 01:39:47.340
many the mysteries that opened to view.

2725
01:39:48.240 --> 01:39:50.980
Ay, saw I man's beginning, learned

2726
01:39:50.980 --> 01:39:52.900
from the past that nothing is new.

2727
01:39:53.800 --> 01:39:55.600
Seek ye, O man, to learn the

2728
01:39:55.600 --> 01:39:57.600
pathway that leads through the spaces

2729
01:39:57.600 --> 01:39:59.560
that are formed forth in time.

2730
01:40:01.340 --> 01:40:03.080
Forget not, O man, with all of

2731
01:40:03.080 --> 01:40:05.060
thy seeking, that light is the goal

2732
01:40:05.060 --> 01:40:06.560
ye shall seek to attain.

2733
01:40:07.460 --> 01:40:08.900
Search ye for the light on thy

2734
01:40:08.900 --> 01:40:10.660
pathway, and ever for thee the goal

2735
01:40:10.660 --> 01:40:11.340
shall endure.

2736
01:40:12.220 --> 01:40:14.100
Let not thine heart turn ever to

2737
01:40:14.100 --> 01:40:16.900
darkness, light let thine soul be

2738
01:40:16.900 --> 01:40:18.240
a sun on the way.

2739
01:40:18.920 --> 01:40:20.940
Know ye that eternal brightness, ye

2740
01:40:20.940 --> 01:40:23.380
shall ever find thy soul hid in light,

2741
01:40:23.820 --> 01:40:25.800
never fettered by bondage or darkness,

2742
01:40:26.260 --> 01:40:28.400
ever it shines forth a sun of

2743
01:40:28.400 --> 01:40:28.920
the light.

2744
01:40:29.800 --> 01:40:31.880
I know though hidden in darkness your

2745
01:40:31.880 --> 01:40:34.160
soul a spark of the true flame exists.

2746
01:40:35.040 --> 01:40:36.660
Be ye one with the greatest of

2747
01:40:36.660 --> 01:40:39.160
all lights, find at the source the

2748
01:40:39.160 --> 01:40:40.020
end of thy goal.

2749
01:40:40.740 --> 01:40:43.020
Light is life, for without the great

2750
01:40:43.020 --> 01:40:44.660
light nothing can ever exist.

2751
01:40:45.440 --> 01:40:47.920
Know ye that in all formed matter

2752
01:40:47.920 --> 01:40:50.000
the heart of light always exists.

2753
01:40:50.580 --> 01:40:52.760
Ay, even though bound in the darkness,

2754
01:40:53.080 --> 01:40:54.920
inherit light always exists.

2755
01:40:56.320 --> 01:40:58.200
Once I stood in the halls of

2756
01:40:58.200 --> 01:41:00.300
Amenti, and heard the voice of the

2757
01:41:00.300 --> 01:41:01.180
lords of Amenti,

2758
01:41:01.700 --> 01:41:03.360
saying in tones that rang through

2759
01:41:03.360 --> 01:41:05.480
the silence words of power, mighty

2760
01:41:05.480 --> 01:41:06.120
and potent.

2761
01:41:06.780 --> 01:41:08.860
Chanted they the song of the cycles,

2762
01:41:09.160 --> 01:41:11.420
the words that open the path to beyond.

2763
01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:14.060
Ay, I saw the great path opened,

2764
01:41:14.340 --> 01:41:16.820
and looked for the instant into the beyond.

2765
01:41:17.420 --> 01:41:19.260
Saw I the movements of the cycles,

2766
01:41:19.840 --> 01:41:21.700
vast as the thought of the source

2767
01:41:21.700 --> 01:41:22.440
could convey.

2768
01:41:23.300 --> 01:41:25.640
Knew I then even infinity is moving

2769
01:41:25.640 --> 01:41:27.440
on to some unthinkable end.

2770
01:41:28.180 --> 01:41:30.180
Saw I that the cosmos is order

2771
01:41:30.180 --> 01:41:32.240
and part of a movement that extends

2772
01:41:32.240 --> 01:41:33.280
to all space,

2773
01:41:33.280 --> 01:41:35.520
a party of an order of orders,

2774
01:41:35.920 --> 01:41:38.200
constantly moving in a harmony of space.

2775
01:41:38.760 --> 01:41:40.940
Saw I the willing of cycles like

2776
01:41:40.940 --> 01:41:42.880
vast circles across the sky.

2777
01:41:43.500 --> 01:41:45.220
Knew I then that all that has

2778
01:41:45.220 --> 01:41:47.340
being is growing to meet yet another

2779
01:41:47.340 --> 01:41:49.020
being in a far off grouping

2780
01:41:49.020 --> 01:41:51.640
of space and of time. Knew I

2781
01:41:51.640 --> 01:41:53.640
then that in words are power to

2782
01:41:53.640 --> 01:41:55.780
open the planes that are hidden from man.

2783
01:41:56.440 --> 01:41:59.300
Ay, that even in words lies hidden

2784
01:41:59.300 --> 01:42:02.000
the key that will open above and below.

2785
01:42:03.560 --> 01:42:06.160
Hark ye now, man, this word I

2786
01:42:06.160 --> 01:42:08.680
leave with thee. Use it, and ye

2787
01:42:08.680 --> 01:42:10.960
shall find power in its sound.

2788
01:42:11.860 --> 01:42:15.800
Say ye the word, Zenuru, and power

2789
01:42:15.800 --> 01:42:16.920
ye shall find.

2790
01:42:17.500 --> 01:42:19.800
Yet must ye understand that man is

2791
01:42:19.800 --> 01:42:21.820
of light, and light is of man.

2792
01:42:22.940 --> 01:42:25.080
List ye, O man, and hear a

2793
01:42:25.080 --> 01:42:27.280
mystery stranger than all that lies

2794
01:42:27.280 --> 01:42:28.280
neath the sun.

2795
01:42:28.920 --> 01:42:31.080
Know ye, O man, that all space

2796
01:42:31.080 --> 01:42:33.600
is filled by worlds within worlds.

2797
01:42:34.180 --> 01:42:36.860
Ay, one within the other yet separate

2798
01:42:36.860 --> 01:42:39.680
by law. Once in my search for

2799
01:42:39.680 --> 01:42:40.920
deep buried wisdom I

2800
01:42:40.920 --> 01:42:42.920
opened the door that bars them from

2801
01:42:42.920 --> 01:42:45.620
man. Called I from the other planes

2802
01:42:45.620 --> 01:42:46.140
of being

2803
01:42:46.140 --> 01:42:48.040
one who was fairer than the daughters

2804
01:42:48.040 --> 01:42:50.860
of men. Ay, I called her from

2805
01:42:50.860 --> 01:42:52.580
out of the spaces to shine

2806
01:42:52.580 --> 01:42:54.160
as a light in the world of

2807
01:42:54.160 --> 01:42:57.940
men. Used I the drum of the serpent.

2808
01:42:58.280 --> 01:43:00.120
Wore I the robe of the purple

2809
01:43:00.120 --> 01:43:02.340
and gold. Placed on my head I

2810
01:43:02.340 --> 01:43:03.380
the crown of silver.

2811
01:43:04.160 --> 01:43:06.440
Around me the circle of cinnabar shone.

2812
01:43:07.160 --> 01:43:09.560
Raised I my arms and cried the invocation

2813
01:43:09.560 --> 01:43:11.560
that opens the path to the planes

2814
01:43:11.560 --> 01:43:14.060
beyond. Cried to the lords of the

2815
01:43:14.060 --> 01:43:15.420
signs in their houses.

2816
01:43:16.500 --> 01:43:19.020
Lords of the two horizons, watchers

2817
01:43:19.020 --> 01:43:21.460
of the treble gates, stand ye one

2818
01:43:21.460 --> 01:43:23.080
at the right and one at the

2819
01:43:23.080 --> 01:43:25.600
left. As the star rises to his

2820
01:43:25.600 --> 01:43:27.640
throne and rules over his sign.

2821
01:43:28.160 --> 01:43:31.420
Ay, thou dark prince of Arulu, open

2822
01:43:31.420 --> 01:43:33.460
the gates of the dim hidden land

2823
01:43:33.460 --> 01:43:35.020
and release her whom ye

2824
01:43:35.020 --> 01:43:37.860
keep imprisoned. Hear ye, hear ye,

2825
01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:40.080
hear ye, dark lords and shining ones,

2826
01:43:40.440 --> 01:43:41.960
and by their secret names,

2827
01:43:42.320 --> 01:43:44.320
names which I know and can pronounce,

2828
01:43:44.860 --> 01:43:47.020
hear ye and obey my will.

2829
01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:50.620
Lit I then with flame my circle

2830
01:43:50.620 --> 01:43:53.220
and called her in the space planes beyond.

2831
01:43:54.080 --> 01:43:56.140
Daughter of light, return from Arulu.

2832
01:43:56.880 --> 01:43:59.180
Seven times and seven times have I

2833
01:43:59.180 --> 01:44:00.540
passed through the fire.

2834
01:44:01.140 --> 01:44:03.440
Food have I not eaten, water I

2835
01:44:03.440 --> 01:44:06.100
have not drunk. I call thee from

2836
01:44:06.100 --> 01:44:08.120
Arulu, from the realms of

2837
01:44:08.120 --> 01:44:10.640
Ekershegul. I summon thee, lady of

2838
01:44:10.640 --> 01:44:14.280
light. Then before me rose the dark figures.

2839
01:44:14.280 --> 01:44:16.600
Ay, the figures of the lords of

2840
01:44:16.600 --> 01:44:19.400
Arulu, parted they before me and forth

2841
01:44:19.400 --> 01:44:20.640
came the lady of light.

2842
01:44:21.420 --> 01:44:23.080
Free was she now from the lords

2843
01:44:23.080 --> 01:44:24.860
of the night, free to live in

2844
01:44:24.860 --> 01:44:26.380
the light of the earth sun,

2845
01:44:26.960 --> 01:44:28.700
free to live as a child of

2846
01:44:28.700 --> 01:44:31.040
the light. Hear ye and listen, O

2847
01:44:31.040 --> 01:44:33.340
my children. Magic is knowledgeable

2848
01:44:33.880 --> 01:44:36.900
and only is law. Be not afraid

2849
01:44:36.900 --> 01:44:38.680
of the power within thee, for it

2850
01:44:38.680 --> 01:44:41.500
follows law as the stars in the sky.

2851
01:44:42.980 --> 01:44:45.420
Know ye that to be without knowledge,

2852
01:44:45.740 --> 01:44:47.420
wisdom is magic and not of the

2853
01:44:47.420 --> 01:44:49.120
law. But know ye that

2854
01:44:49.120 --> 01:44:51.120
ever ye by your knowledge can approach

2855
01:44:51.120 --> 01:44:53.060
closer to a place in the sun.

2856
01:44:53.980 --> 01:44:55.040
List ye, my children,

2857
01:44:55.560 --> 01:44:58.440
follow my teaching. Be ye ever seeker

2858
01:44:58.440 --> 01:45:00.500
of light. Shine in the world of

2859
01:45:00.500 --> 01:45:01.680
men all around thee,

2860
01:45:02.280 --> 01:45:03.860
a light on the path that shall

2861
01:45:03.860 --> 01:45:07.100
shine among men. Follow ye and learn

2862
01:45:07.100 --> 01:45:09.280
of my magic. Know that all

2863
01:45:09.280 --> 01:45:12.120
force is thine if thou wilt. Fear

2864
01:45:12.120 --> 01:45:13.820
not the path that leads thee to

2865
01:45:13.820 --> 01:45:15.360
knowledge, but rather shun ye

2866
01:45:15.360 --> 01:45:19.040
the dark road. Light is thine, O

2867
01:45:19.040 --> 01:45:21.420
man, for the taking. Cast off the

2868
01:45:21.420 --> 01:45:22.760
fetters and thou shalt be

2869
01:45:22.760 --> 01:45:25.800
free. Know ye that thy soul is

2870
01:45:25.800 --> 01:45:27.920
living in bondage feathered by fears

2871
01:45:27.920 --> 01:45:29.260
that hold ye in thrall.

2872
01:45:29.820 --> 01:45:31.540
Open thy eyes and see the great

2873
01:45:31.540 --> 01:45:34.480
sunlight. Be not afraid, for all is

2874
01:45:34.480 --> 01:45:36.440
thine own. Fear is the

2875
01:45:36.440 --> 01:45:38.480
lord of the dark, a rulu, to

2876
01:45:38.480 --> 01:45:40.380
he who never faced the dark fear.

2877
01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:43.160
Ay, know that fear has existence

2878
01:45:43.160 --> 01:45:45.140
created by those who are bound by

2879
01:45:45.140 --> 01:45:47.940
their fears. Shake off thy bondage,

2880
01:45:48.040 --> 01:45:49.560
O children, and walk in

2881
01:45:49.560 --> 01:45:52.060
the light of the glorious day. Never

2882
01:45:52.060 --> 01:45:54.280
turn thy thoughts to the darkness,

2883
01:45:54.440 --> 01:45:55.380
and surely ye shall

2884
01:45:55.380 --> 01:45:58.640
be one with the light. Man is

2885
01:45:58.640 --> 01:46:00.900
only what he believeth, a brother

2886
01:46:00.900 --> 01:46:02.900
of darkness or a child of the

2887
01:46:02.900 --> 01:46:05.560
light. Come thou into the light, my

2888
01:46:05.560 --> 01:46:08.000
children. Walk in the pathway that

2889
01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:09.200
leads to the sun.

2890
01:46:10.380 --> 01:46:12.320
Hark ye now and list to the

2891
01:46:12.320 --> 01:46:14.940
wisdom. Use thou the word I have

2892
01:46:14.940 --> 01:46:15.800
given unto thee.

2893
01:46:16.500 --> 01:46:18.720
Use it, and surely thou shalt find

2894
01:46:18.720 --> 01:46:20.500
power and wisdom and light to walk

2895
01:46:20.500 --> 01:46:21.000
in the way.

2896
01:46:21.860 --> 01:46:24.220
Seek thee, and find the key I

2897
01:46:24.220 --> 01:46:26.700
have given, and ever shalt thou be

2898
01:46:26.700 --> 01:46:28.000
a child of the light.

2899
01:46:33.940 --> 01:46:36.040
Hear ye, and list ye, O children

2900
01:46:36.040 --> 01:46:37.760
of Kim, to the words that I

2901
01:46:37.760 --> 01:46:39.300
give that shall bring ye to the

2902
01:46:39.300 --> 01:46:41.480
light. Ye know, O men, that I

2903
01:46:41.480 --> 01:46:43.700
knew your fathers, ay, your fathers

2904
01:46:43.700 --> 01:46:46.220
in a time long ago. Deathless

2905
01:46:46.220 --> 01:46:48.000
have I been through all the ages,

2906
01:46:48.500 --> 01:46:50.160
living among ye since your knowledge

2907
01:46:50.160 --> 01:46:52.440
began. Leading you upward

2908
01:46:52.440 --> 01:46:54.040
to the light of the great soul

2909
01:46:54.040 --> 01:46:56.440
have I ever striven, drawing ye from

2910
01:46:56.440 --> 01:46:57.500
out of the darkness of

2911
01:46:57.500 --> 01:46:59.900
night. Know ye, O people, amongst

2912
01:46:59.900 --> 01:47:01.760
whom I walk, that I, Thoth, have

2913
01:47:01.760 --> 01:47:03.300
all the knowledge and all

2914
01:47:03.300 --> 01:47:05.040
of the wisdom known to man since

2915
01:47:05.040 --> 01:47:07.520
the ancient days. Keeper have I been

2916
01:47:07.520 --> 01:47:08.480
of the secrets of the

2917
01:47:08.480 --> 01:47:10.640
great race, holder of the key that

2918
01:47:10.640 --> 01:47:13.380
leads into life. Bringer up have I

2919
01:47:13.380 --> 01:47:15.260
been to ye, O my children,

2920
01:47:15.260 --> 01:47:17.200
even from the darkness of the ancient

2921
01:47:17.200 --> 01:47:19.700
of days. List ye now to the

2922
01:47:19.700 --> 01:47:21.540
words of my wisdom, list ye

2923
01:47:21.540 --> 01:47:23.640
now to the message I bring. Hear

2924
01:47:23.640 --> 01:47:25.240
ye now the words I give thee,

2925
01:47:25.480 --> 01:47:27.160
and ye shall be raised from the

2926
01:47:27.160 --> 01:47:30.800
darkness to light. Far in the past,

2927
01:47:30.940 --> 01:47:33.000
when I first came to thee, found

2928
01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:34.900
I thee in caves of rocks.

2929
01:47:35.680 --> 01:47:37.360
Lifted I thee by my power and

2930
01:47:37.360 --> 01:47:39.420
wisdom until thou didst shine as men

2931
01:47:39.420 --> 01:47:40.060
among men.

2932
01:47:40.620 --> 01:47:43.260
Ay, found I thee without any knowing,

2933
01:47:43.820 --> 01:47:46.240
only a little were ye raised beyond beast.

2934
01:47:46.960 --> 01:47:48.660
Fanned I ever the spark of thy

2935
01:47:48.660 --> 01:47:50.780
consciousness until at last ye flamed

2936
01:47:50.780 --> 01:47:52.680
as men. Now shall I

2937
01:47:52.680 --> 01:47:54.840
speak to thee knowledge ancient beyond

2938
01:47:54.840 --> 01:47:57.080
the thought of thy race. Know ye

2939
01:47:57.080 --> 01:47:58.500
that we of the great race

2940
01:47:58.500 --> 01:48:00.600
had and have knowledge that is more

2941
01:48:00.600 --> 01:48:03.320
than man's. Wisdom we gained from

2942
01:48:03.320 --> 01:48:04.480
the star-born races,

2943
01:48:05.040 --> 01:48:07.360
wisdom and knowledge far beyond man.

2944
01:48:08.080 --> 01:48:10.060
Down to us had descended the masters

2945
01:48:10.060 --> 01:48:11.100
of wisdom as far

2946
01:48:11.100 --> 01:48:13.140
beyond us as I am from thee.

2947
01:48:13.920 --> 01:48:15.640
List ye now while I give ye

2948
01:48:15.640 --> 01:48:18.940
wisdom, use it, and free thou shalt be.

2949
01:48:19.620 --> 01:48:21.280
Know ye that in the pyramid I

2950
01:48:21.280 --> 01:48:23.120
builded are the keys that shall show

2951
01:48:23.120 --> 01:48:24.440
ye the way into life.

2952
01:48:25.120 --> 01:48:26.880
Ay, draw ye a line from the

2953
01:48:26.880 --> 01:48:28.980
great image I builded to the apex

2954
01:48:28.980 --> 01:48:30.820
of the pyramid built as a gateway.

2955
01:48:30.820 --> 01:48:33.360
Draw ye another opposite in the same

2956
01:48:33.360 --> 01:48:35.780
angle and direction. Dig ye and find

2957
01:48:35.780 --> 01:48:36.540
that which I have

2958
01:48:36.540 --> 01:48:38.980
hidden. There shall ye find the underground

2959
01:48:38.980 --> 01:48:41.320
entrance to the secrets hidden before

2960
01:48:41.320 --> 01:48:42.240
ye were men.

2961
01:48:43.320 --> 01:48:45.400
Tell ye I now of the mystery

2962
01:48:45.400 --> 01:48:47.440
of cycles that move in movements that

2963
01:48:47.440 --> 01:48:48.740
are strange to the finite,

2964
01:48:49.280 --> 01:48:51.040
for infinite are they beyond knowledge

2965
01:48:51.040 --> 01:48:53.240
of man. Know ye that there are

2966
01:48:53.240 --> 01:48:54.880
nine of the cycles. Ay,

2967
01:48:54.880 --> 01:48:58.180
nine above and fourteen below, moving

2968
01:48:58.180 --> 01:49:00.000
in harmony to the place of joining,

2969
01:49:00.540 --> 01:49:02.060
that shall exist in the future of

2970
01:49:02.060 --> 01:49:04.520
time. Know ye that the lords of

2971
01:49:04.520 --> 01:49:05.760
the cycles are units of

2972
01:49:05.760 --> 01:49:07.340
consciousness sent from the others

2973
01:49:07.340 --> 01:49:10.620
to unify this with the all. Highest

2974
01:49:10.620 --> 01:49:11.240
are they of the

2975
01:49:11.240 --> 01:49:13.120
consciousness of all the cycles, working

2976
01:49:13.120 --> 01:49:15.620
in harmony with the law. Know they

2977
01:49:15.620 --> 01:49:16.420
that in time

2978
01:49:16.420 --> 01:49:18.560
all will be perfected, having none

2979
01:49:18.560 --> 01:49:21.300
above and none below, but all one

2980
01:49:21.300 --> 01:49:22.620
in a perfected infinity,

2981
01:49:22.620 --> 01:49:25.080
a harmony of all in the oneness

2982
01:49:25.080 --> 01:49:29.060
of all. Deep neath the earth surface

2983
01:49:29.060 --> 01:49:29.720
in the halls

2984
01:49:29.720 --> 01:49:31.880
of Amenti sit the seven, the lords

2985
01:49:31.880 --> 01:49:34.280
of the cycles. Ay, and another the

2986
01:49:34.280 --> 01:49:35.140
lord from below.

2987
01:49:35.720 --> 01:49:37.620
Yet know ye that in infinity there

2988
01:49:37.620 --> 01:49:40.200
is neither above nor below, but ever

2989
01:49:40.200 --> 01:49:41.600
there is and ever shall

2990
01:49:41.600 --> 01:49:43.700
be oneness of all when all is

2991
01:49:43.700 --> 01:49:46.260
complete. Oft have I stood before

2992
01:49:46.260 --> 01:49:47.360
the lords of the all,

2993
01:49:47.920 --> 01:49:49.220
oft at the front of their wisdom

2994
01:49:49.220 --> 01:49:51.000
have drunken and filled both my body

2995
01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:52.360
and soul with their light.

2996
01:49:53.060 --> 01:49:54.820
Spake they to me and told me

2997
01:49:54.820 --> 01:49:56.440
of cycles and the law that gives

2998
01:49:56.440 --> 01:49:57.880
them the means to exist.

2999
01:49:58.480 --> 01:50:00.620
Ay, spake to me the lord of

3000
01:50:00.620 --> 01:50:03.640
the nine, saying, O Thoth, great are

3001
01:50:03.640 --> 01:50:05.120
ye among earth children,

3002
01:50:05.540 --> 01:50:07.680
but mysteries exist of which ye know

3003
01:50:07.680 --> 01:50:10.300
not. Ye know that ye came from

3004
01:50:10.300 --> 01:50:11.800
a space-time below this,

3005
01:50:12.180 --> 01:50:13.800
and know ye shall travel to a

3006
01:50:13.800 --> 01:50:16.500
space-time beyond. But little ye know

3007
01:50:16.500 --> 01:50:17.860
of the mysteries within them,

3008
01:50:17.860 --> 01:50:20.360
little ye know of the wisdom beyond.

3009
01:50:21.140 --> 01:50:23.040
Know ye that ye, as a whole

3010
01:50:23.040 --> 01:50:23.820
in the consciousness,

3011
01:50:24.060 --> 01:50:26.120
are only a cell in the process

3012
01:50:26.120 --> 01:50:29.020
of growth. The consciousness below

3013
01:50:29.020 --> 01:50:30.340
thee is ever expanding

3014
01:50:30.340 --> 01:50:32.060
in different ways from those known

3015
01:50:32.060 --> 01:50:35.080
to thee. Ay, it, though in space

3016
01:50:35.080 --> 01:50:35.960
-time below thee,

3017
01:50:36.120 --> 01:50:37.780
is ever growing in ways that are

3018
01:50:37.780 --> 01:50:39.160
different from those that were part

3019
01:50:39.160 --> 01:50:40.260
of the ways of thine own.

3020
01:50:41.120 --> 01:50:42.420
For know that it grows as a

3021
01:50:42.420 --> 01:50:44.040
result of thy growth, but not in

3022
01:50:44.040 --> 01:50:45.640
the same way that thou didst grow.

3023
01:50:45.640 --> 01:50:48.220
The growth that thou had and have

3024
01:50:48.220 --> 01:50:50.280
in the present have brought into being

3025
01:50:50.280 --> 01:50:51.400
a cause and effect.

3026
01:50:52.120 --> 01:50:53.700
No consciousness follows the path

3027
01:50:53.700 --> 01:50:55.740
of those before it, else all would

3028
01:50:55.740 --> 01:50:56.980
be repetition and vain.

3029
01:50:57.620 --> 01:50:59.200
Each consciousness in the cycle it

3030
01:50:59.200 --> 01:51:01.460
exists and follows its own path to

3031
01:51:01.460 --> 01:51:02.280
the ultimate goal.

3032
01:51:02.900 --> 01:51:04.600
Each plays its part in the plan

3033
01:51:04.600 --> 01:51:07.060
of the cosmos. Each plays its part

3034
01:51:07.060 --> 01:51:08.080
in the ultimate end.

3035
01:51:08.880 --> 01:51:10.620
The farther the cycle, the greater

3036
01:51:10.620 --> 01:51:12.240
its knowledge and ability to blend

3037
01:51:12.240 --> 01:51:13.240
the law of the whole.

3038
01:51:13.880 --> 01:51:15.600
Know ye that ye in the cycles

3039
01:51:15.600 --> 01:51:18.080
below us are working the minor parts

3040
01:51:18.080 --> 01:51:18.580
of the law,

3041
01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:20.760
while we of the cycle that extends

3042
01:51:20.760 --> 01:51:23.140
to infinity take of the striving and

3043
01:51:23.140 --> 01:51:24.040
build greater law.

3044
01:51:25.180 --> 01:51:26.960
Each has his own part to play

3045
01:51:26.960 --> 01:51:28.960
in the cycles. Each has his work

3046
01:51:28.960 --> 01:51:30.240
to complete in his way.

3047
01:51:30.820 --> 01:51:32.620
The cycle below thee is yet not

3048
01:51:32.620 --> 01:51:34.460
below thee, but only formed for a

3049
01:51:34.460 --> 01:51:35.320
need that exists.

3050
01:51:36.040 --> 01:51:37.640
For know ye that the fountain of

3051
01:51:37.640 --> 01:51:39.500
wisdom that sends forth the cycles

3052
01:51:39.500 --> 01:51:41.020
is eternally seeking

3053
01:51:41.020 --> 01:51:43.660
new powers to gain. Ye know that

3054
01:51:43.660 --> 01:51:45.360
knowledge is gained only by practice,

3055
01:51:45.800 --> 01:51:47.660
and wisdom comes forth only from knowledge,

3056
01:51:48.160 --> 01:51:50.140
and thus are the cycles created by law.

3057
01:51:51.220 --> 01:51:53.100
Means are they for the gaining of

3058
01:51:53.100 --> 01:51:54.620
knowledge for the plane of law that

3059
01:51:54.620 --> 01:51:55.820
is the source of the all.

3060
01:51:56.380 --> 01:51:58.280
The cycle below is not truly below,

3061
01:51:58.680 --> 01:52:00.560
but only different in space and in time.

3062
01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:02.700
The consciousness there is working

3063
01:52:02.700 --> 01:52:04.940
and testing lesser things than those

3064
01:52:04.940 --> 01:52:05.400
ye are.

3065
01:52:06.040 --> 01:52:08.040
And know, just as ye are working

3066
01:52:08.040 --> 01:52:10.180
on greater, so above ye are those

3067
01:52:10.180 --> 01:52:11.420
who are also working as

3068
01:52:11.420 --> 01:52:13.720
ye are on yet other laws. The

3069
01:52:13.720 --> 01:52:15.340
difference that exists between the

3070
01:52:15.340 --> 01:52:16.660
cycles is only in ability

3071
01:52:16.660 --> 01:52:18.980
to work with the law. We, who

3072
01:52:18.980 --> 01:52:20.660
have being in cycles beyond thee,

3073
01:52:20.960 --> 01:52:22.400
are those who first came

3074
01:52:22.400 --> 01:52:24.120
forth for the source and have in

3075
01:52:24.120 --> 01:52:25.780
the passage through time and space

3076
01:52:25.780 --> 01:52:27.220
gained ability to use

3077
01:52:27.220 --> 01:52:28.980
laws of the greater that are far

3078
01:52:28.980 --> 01:52:31.460
beyond the conception of man. Nothing

3079
01:52:31.460 --> 01:52:32.800
there is that is

3080
01:52:32.800 --> 01:52:34.880
really below thee, but only a different

3081
01:52:34.880 --> 01:52:38.060
operation of law. Look thee above,

3082
01:52:38.340 --> 01:52:39.320
or look thee below,

3083
01:52:39.800 --> 01:52:42.140
the same shall ye find. For all

3084
01:52:42.140 --> 01:52:43.600
is but part of the oneness that

3085
01:52:43.600 --> 01:52:45.000
is at the source of the law.

3086
01:52:45.320 --> 01:52:47.220
The consciousness below thee is part

3087
01:52:47.220 --> 01:52:49.240
of thine own, as we are a

3088
01:52:49.240 --> 01:52:49.900
part of thine.

3089
01:52:50.640 --> 01:52:52.280
Ye, as a child, had not the

3090
01:52:52.280 --> 01:52:53.900
knowledge that came to ye when ye

3091
01:52:53.900 --> 01:52:54.660
became a man.

3092
01:52:55.480 --> 01:52:57.300
Compare ye the cycles to man in

3093
01:52:57.300 --> 01:52:58.860
his journey from birth unto death,

3094
01:52:58.860 --> 01:53:00.980
and see in the cycle below thee

3095
01:53:00.980 --> 01:53:02.900
the child with the knowledge he has.

3096
01:53:03.320 --> 01:53:04.880
And see ye yourself as

3097
01:53:04.880 --> 01:53:06.980
the child grown older, advancing in

3098
01:53:06.980 --> 01:53:10.040
knowledge as time passes on. See ye,

3099
01:53:10.300 --> 01:53:11.840
we also, the child

3100
01:53:11.840 --> 01:53:13.920
grown to manhood with the knowledge

3101
01:53:13.920 --> 01:53:15.680
and wisdom that came with the years.

3102
01:53:16.340 --> 01:53:18.520
So also, O Thoth are

3103
01:53:18.520 --> 01:53:20.800
the cycles of consciousness, children

3104
01:53:20.800 --> 01:53:23.040
in different stages of growth, yet

3105
01:53:23.040 --> 01:53:24.520
all from the one source,

3106
01:53:24.520 --> 01:53:26.760
the wisdom, and all to the wisdom

3107
01:53:26.760 --> 01:53:30.580
returning again. Ceased then he from

3108
01:53:30.580 --> 01:53:31.760
speaking, and set in

3109
01:53:31.760 --> 01:53:33.560
the silence that comes to the lords.

3110
01:53:34.060 --> 01:53:36.240
Then again spake he unto me, saying,

3111
01:53:36.720 --> 01:53:38.500
O Thoth, long have we

3112
01:53:38.500 --> 01:53:40.240
set in amenti, guarding the flame

3113
01:53:40.240 --> 01:53:42.540
of life in the halls. Yet know,

3114
01:53:42.940 --> 01:53:44.460
we are still part of our cycles,

3115
01:53:44.660 --> 01:53:46.280
with our vision reaching unto them

3116
01:53:46.280 --> 01:53:49.040
and beyond. Ay, know we that of

3117
01:53:49.040 --> 01:53:50.540
all, nothing else matters

3118
01:53:50.540 --> 01:53:52.420
excepting the growth we can gain with

3119
01:53:52.420 --> 01:53:54.860
our soul. Know we the flesh is

3120
01:53:54.860 --> 01:53:56.320
fleeting, the things men

3121
01:53:56.320 --> 01:53:58.540
count great are nothing to us, the

3122
01:53:58.540 --> 01:54:00.040
things we seek are not of the

3123
01:54:00.040 --> 01:54:02.120
body, but are only the perfected

3124
01:54:02.120 --> 01:54:04.360
state of the soul. When ye as

3125
01:54:04.360 --> 01:54:06.500
men can learn that nothing but progress

3126
01:54:06.500 --> 01:54:08.340
of soul can count in the end,

3127
01:54:08.720 --> 01:54:10.760
then truly ye are free from all

3128
01:54:10.760 --> 01:54:13.480
bondage, free to work, in a harmony

3129
01:54:13.480 --> 01:54:14.180
of law.

3130
01:54:15.220 --> 01:54:17.260
Know, old man, ye should aim at

3131
01:54:17.260 --> 01:54:19.960
perfection, for only thus can ye attain

3132
01:54:19.960 --> 01:54:21.840
to the goal. Though ye

3133
01:54:21.840 --> 01:54:23.440
should know that nothing is perfect,

3134
01:54:24.040 --> 01:54:25.980
yet it should be thy aim and

3135
01:54:25.980 --> 01:54:28.420
thy goal. Ceased again the voice of

3136
01:54:28.420 --> 01:54:30.240
the nine, and into my consciousness

3137
01:54:30.240 --> 01:54:32.760
the words had sunk. Now seek I

3138
01:54:32.760 --> 01:54:34.280
ever more wisdom that I may be

3139
01:54:34.280 --> 01:54:36.960
perfect in law with thee all. Soon

3140
01:54:36.960 --> 01:54:38.440
go I down to the halls of

3141
01:54:38.440 --> 01:54:40.560
amenti to live beneath the cold flower

3142
01:54:40.560 --> 01:54:42.920
of life. Ye whom I have taught

3143
01:54:42.920 --> 01:54:45.060
shall never more see me, yet live

3144
01:54:45.060 --> 01:54:46.880
I forever in the wisdom I taught.

3145
01:54:47.520 --> 01:54:49.460
All that man is, is because of

3146
01:54:49.460 --> 01:54:51.640
his wisdom. All that he shall be,

3147
01:54:51.840 --> 01:54:53.500
is the result of his cause.

3148
01:54:54.140 --> 01:54:56.060
List ye now to my voice, and

3149
01:54:56.060 --> 01:54:58.780
become greater than common man. Lift

3150
01:54:58.780 --> 01:55:01.080
thine eyes upward, let light

3151
01:55:01.080 --> 01:55:03.420
fill thy being, be thou ever children

3152
01:55:03.420 --> 01:55:06.560
of light. Only by effort shall ye

3153
01:55:06.560 --> 01:55:07.880
grow upward to the plane

3154
01:55:07.880 --> 01:55:09.480
where light is the all of the

3155
01:55:09.480 --> 01:55:11.600
all. Be ye the master of all

3156
01:55:11.600 --> 01:55:14.220
that surrounds thee. Never be mastered by

3157
01:55:14.220 --> 01:55:16.900
the effects of thy life. Create then

3158
01:55:16.900 --> 01:55:19.060
ever more perfect causes, and in time

3159
01:55:19.060 --> 01:55:20.700
shalt thou be a son

3160
01:55:20.700 --> 01:55:23.740
of the light. Free, let thine soul

3161
01:55:23.740 --> 01:55:26.500
soar ever upward, free from the bondage

3162
01:55:26.500 --> 01:55:27.500
and fetters of night.

3163
01:55:28.040 --> 01:55:29.780
Lift thine eyes to the sun in

3164
01:55:29.780 --> 01:55:32.360
the sky-space. For thee, let it

3165
01:55:32.360 --> 01:55:34.840
be a symbol of life. Know that thou

3166
01:55:34.840 --> 01:55:36.700
art the greater light, perfect in

3167
01:55:36.700 --> 01:55:39.120
thine own sphere, when thou art free.

3168
01:55:39.600 --> 01:55:40.840
Look not ever into

3169
01:55:40.840 --> 01:55:43.120
the blackness. Lift up thine eyes

3170
01:55:43.120 --> 01:55:46.200
to the space above. Free, let thine

3171
01:55:46.200 --> 01:55:48.040
light flame upward, and

3172
01:55:48.040 --> 01:55:49.960
shalt thou be a child of the light.

3173
01:55:56.280 --> 01:55:58.160
List ye, O man, to the words

3174
01:55:58.160 --> 01:56:00.260
of my wisdom. List to the voice

3175
01:56:00.260 --> 01:56:01.640
of Thoth the Atlantean.

3176
01:56:02.280 --> 01:56:04.240
Conquered have I the law of time

3177
01:56:04.240 --> 01:56:06.400
-space. Knowledge have I gained of

3178
01:56:06.400 --> 01:56:07.400
the future of time.

3179
01:56:08.080 --> 01:56:09.900
Know I that man, in his movement

3180
01:56:09.900 --> 01:56:11.520
through space-time, shall ever be

3181
01:56:11.520 --> 01:56:12.540
one with the all.

3182
01:56:13.320 --> 01:56:15.260
Know ye, O man, that all of

3183
01:56:15.260 --> 01:56:16.760
the future is an open book to

3184
01:56:16.760 --> 01:56:20.060
him who can read. All effect shall bring

3185
01:56:20.060 --> 01:56:22.840
forth its causes, as all effects grew

3186
01:56:22.840 --> 01:56:25.360
from the first cause. Know ye the

3187
01:56:25.360 --> 01:56:26.840
future is not fixed or

3188
01:56:26.840 --> 01:56:29.340
stable, but varies as cause brings

3189
01:56:29.340 --> 01:56:31.980
forth an effect. Look in the cause

3190
01:56:31.980 --> 01:56:33.260
thou shalt bring into

3191
01:56:33.260 --> 01:56:35.820
being, and surely thou shalt see that

3192
01:56:35.820 --> 01:56:39.360
all is effect. So, O man, be

3193
01:56:39.360 --> 01:56:40.640
sure the effects that ye

3194
01:56:40.640 --> 01:56:42.680
bring forth are ever causes of more

3195
01:56:42.680 --> 01:56:45.320
perfect effects. Know ye, the future

3196
01:56:45.320 --> 01:56:46.600
is never in fixation

3197
01:56:46.600 --> 01:56:48.520
but follows man's free will as it

3198
01:56:48.520 --> 01:56:50.240
moves through the movements of time

3199
01:56:50.240 --> 01:56:52.060
-space toward the goal where

3200
01:56:52.060 --> 01:56:54.820
a new time begins. Man can only

3201
01:56:54.820 --> 01:56:56.240
read the future through the causes

3202
01:56:56.240 --> 01:56:57.480
that bring the effects.

3203
01:56:58.220 --> 01:57:00.300
Seek ye within the causation and surely

3204
01:57:00.300 --> 01:57:03.140
ye shall find the effects. List ye,

3205
01:57:03.200 --> 01:57:04.540
O man, while I speak

3206
01:57:04.540 --> 01:57:06.680
of the future. Speak of the effect

3207
01:57:06.680 --> 01:57:09.120
that follows the cause. Know ye that

3208
01:57:09.120 --> 01:57:10.240
man in his journey

3209
01:57:10.240 --> 01:57:12.740
lightward is ever seeking escape from

3210
01:57:12.740 --> 01:57:14.580
the night that surrounds him, like

3211
01:57:14.580 --> 01:57:15.800
the shadows that surround

3212
01:57:15.800 --> 01:57:17.880
the stars in the sky, like the

3213
01:57:17.880 --> 01:57:19.860
stars in the sky-space he too

3214
01:57:19.860 --> 01:57:22.340
shall shine from the shadows of

3215
01:57:22.340 --> 01:57:25.040
night. Ever his destiny shall lead

3216
01:57:25.040 --> 01:57:27.160
him onward until he is one with

3217
01:57:27.160 --> 01:57:30.660
the light. Ay, though his way lies

3218
01:57:30.660 --> 01:57:32.840
midst the shadows, ever before him

3219
01:57:32.840 --> 01:57:35.180
glows the great light. Dark though

3220
01:57:35.180 --> 01:57:36.940
the way be, yet shall he

3221
01:57:36.940 --> 01:57:38.760
conquer the shadows that flow around

3222
01:57:38.760 --> 01:57:41.160
him like night. Far in the future

3223
01:57:41.160 --> 01:57:42.880
I see man as light-born,

3224
01:57:42.880 --> 01:57:44.800
free from the darkness that fetters

3225
01:57:44.800 --> 01:57:46.800
the soul, living in light without

3226
01:57:46.800 --> 01:57:48.160
the bounds of the darkness

3227
01:57:48.160 --> 01:57:50.100
to cover the light that is light

3228
01:57:50.100 --> 01:57:52.420
of their soul. Know ye, O man,

3229
01:57:52.760 --> 01:57:54.980
before ye attain this, that many

3230
01:57:54.980 --> 01:57:56.700
the dark shadows shall fall on your

3231
01:57:56.700 --> 01:57:58.820
light, striving to quench with the

3232
01:57:58.820 --> 01:58:00.320
shadows of darkness the light

3233
01:58:00.320 --> 01:58:01.940
of the soul that strives to be

3234
01:58:01.940 --> 01:58:05.320
free. Great is the struggle between

3235
01:58:05.320 --> 01:58:07.580
light and darkness, age-old and

3236
01:58:07.580 --> 01:58:10.200
ever new. Yet know in time, far

3237
01:58:10.200 --> 01:58:12.040
in the future, light shall be all,

3238
01:58:12.200 --> 01:58:13.400
and darkness shall fall.

3239
01:58:14.080 --> 01:58:15.520
List ye, O man, to my words

3240
01:58:15.520 --> 01:58:17.800
of wisdom. Prepare, and ye shall not

3241
01:58:17.800 --> 01:58:19.960
bind your light. Man has risen,

3242
01:58:20.140 --> 01:58:22.080
and man has fallen, as ever new

3243
01:58:22.080 --> 01:58:23.980
waves of consciousness flow from the

3244
01:58:23.980 --> 01:58:24.560
great abyss

3245
01:58:24.560 --> 01:58:26.240
below us toward the sun of their

3246
01:58:26.240 --> 01:58:28.900
goal. Ye, my children, have risen

3247
01:58:28.900 --> 01:58:30.280
from a state that was little

3248
01:58:30.280 --> 01:58:32.500
above the beast, until now of all

3249
01:58:32.500 --> 01:58:35.220
men ye are greatest. Yet before thee

3250
01:58:35.220 --> 01:58:36.420
were others greater

3251
01:58:36.420 --> 01:58:38.820
than thee, yet tell I thee as

3252
01:58:38.820 --> 01:58:41.280
before thee others have fallen, so

3253
01:58:41.280 --> 01:58:44.460
also ye come to an end. And upon

3254
01:58:44.460 --> 01:58:47.080
the land where ye dwell now, barbarians

3255
01:58:47.080 --> 01:58:49.340
shall dwell, and in turn rise to

3256
01:58:49.340 --> 01:58:51.020
light. Forgotten shall

3257
01:58:51.020 --> 01:58:53.420
be the ancient wisdom, yet ever shall

3258
01:58:53.420 --> 01:58:57.360
live though hidden from men. Ay, in

3259
01:58:57.360 --> 01:58:58.460
the land thou callest

3260
01:58:58.460 --> 01:59:01.520
Kim, races shall rise and races shall

3261
01:59:01.520 --> 01:59:04.360
fall. Forgotten shalt thou be of the

3262
01:59:04.360 --> 01:59:05.140
children of men,

3263
01:59:05.140 --> 01:59:07.480
yet thou shalt have moved to a

3264
01:59:07.480 --> 01:59:09.680
star-space beyond this, leaving behind

3265
01:59:09.680 --> 01:59:11.160
this place where thou

3266
01:59:11.160 --> 01:59:14.180
hast dwelt. The soul of man moves

3267
01:59:14.180 --> 01:59:16.980
ever onward, bound not by any one

3268
01:59:16.980 --> 01:59:19.080
star, but ever moving to

3269
01:59:19.080 --> 01:59:20.920
the great goal before him where he

3270
01:59:20.920 --> 01:59:22.460
is dissolved in the light of the

3271
01:59:22.460 --> 01:59:24.540
all. Know ye that ye shall

3272
01:59:24.540 --> 01:59:26.800
ever go onward, moved by the law

3273
01:59:26.800 --> 01:59:28.520
of cause and effect, until in the

3274
01:59:28.520 --> 01:59:30.280
end both become one.

3275
01:59:31.700 --> 01:59:34.540
Ay, man, after ye have gone, others

3276
01:59:34.540 --> 01:59:36.620
shall move in the places ye lived.

3277
01:59:37.120 --> 01:59:38.080
Knowledge and wisdom

3278
01:59:38.080 --> 01:59:40.380
shall all be forgotten, and only a

3279
01:59:40.380 --> 01:59:43.060
memory of God's shall survive. As

3280
01:59:43.060 --> 01:59:44.720
I to thee am a God by

3281
01:59:44.720 --> 01:59:46.940
my knowledge, so ye too shall be

3282
01:59:46.940 --> 01:59:48.720
gods of the future, because of your

3283
01:59:48.720 --> 01:59:49.700
knowledge far above

3284
01:59:49.700 --> 01:59:52.340
theirs. Yet know ye that all through

3285
01:59:52.340 --> 01:59:54.400
the ages man shall have access to

3286
01:59:54.400 --> 01:59:57.120
law when he will. Ages

3287
01:59:57.120 --> 01:59:59.200
to come shall see revival of wisdom

3288
01:59:59.200 --> 02:00:01.200
to those who shall inherit thy place

3289
02:00:01.200 --> 02:00:02.980
on this star. They

3290
02:00:02.980 --> 02:00:05.380
shall, in turn, come into wisdom and

3291
02:00:05.380 --> 02:00:07.480
learn to banish the darkness by light.

3292
02:00:08.060 --> 02:00:09.080
Yet greatly must

3293
02:00:09.080 --> 02:00:10.980
they strive through the ages to bring

3294
02:00:10.980 --> 02:00:12.960
unto themselves the freedom of light.

3295
02:00:13.540 --> 02:00:14.100
Then shall

3296
02:00:14.100 --> 02:00:16.480
there come unto man the great warfare

3297
02:00:16.480 --> 02:00:18.440
that shall make the earth tremble

3298
02:00:18.440 --> 02:00:19.800
and shake in its course.

3299
02:00:20.560 --> 02:00:23.160
Ay, then shall the dark brothers open

3300
02:00:23.160 --> 02:00:25.460
the warfare between light and the night.

3301
02:00:26.320 --> 02:00:28.840
When man again shall conquer the ocean

3302
02:00:28.840 --> 02:00:30.340
and fly in the air on wings

3303
02:00:30.340 --> 02:00:31.160
like the birds,

3304
02:00:31.340 --> 02:00:33.300
when he has learned to harness the

3305
02:00:33.300 --> 02:00:35.200
lightning, then shall the time of

3306
02:00:35.200 --> 02:00:37.260
warfare begin. Great

3307
02:00:37.260 --> 02:00:39.220
shall the battle be, twixt the forces,

3308
02:00:39.480 --> 02:00:41.040
great the warfare of darkness and

3309
02:00:41.040 --> 02:00:42.280
light. Nation

3310
02:00:42.280 --> 02:00:44.420
shall rise against nation, using the

3311
02:00:44.420 --> 02:00:46.060
dark forces to shatter the earth.

3312
02:00:46.680 --> 02:00:47.700
Weapons of force

3313
02:00:47.700 --> 02:00:50.020
shall wipe out the earth man, until

3314
02:00:50.020 --> 02:00:51.820
half of the races of men shall

3315
02:00:51.820 --> 02:00:53.760
be gone. Then shall

3316
02:00:53.760 --> 02:00:55.540
come forth the sons of the morning,

3317
02:00:56.040 --> 02:00:57.780
and give their edict to the children

3318
02:00:57.780 --> 02:00:58.720
of men, saying,

3319
02:00:59.200 --> 02:01:01.600
O men, cease from thy striving against

3320
02:01:01.600 --> 02:01:03.920
thy brother, only thus can ye come

3321
02:01:03.920 --> 02:01:04.580
to the light.

3322
02:01:04.920 --> 02:01:07.260
Cease from thy unbelief, O my brother,

3323
02:01:07.400 --> 02:01:09.380
and follow the path, and know ye

3324
02:01:09.380 --> 02:01:09.980
are right.

3325
02:01:11.420 --> 02:01:13.700
Then shall men cease from their striving,

3326
02:01:13.900 --> 02:01:15.500
brother against brother and father

3327
02:01:15.500 --> 02:01:16.400
against son.

3328
02:01:16.940 --> 02:01:18.780
Then shall the ancient home of my

3329
02:01:18.780 --> 02:01:20.740
people rise from its place beneath

3330
02:01:20.740 --> 02:01:22.160
the dark ocean waves.

3331
02:01:22.160 --> 02:01:24.320
Then shall the age of light be

3332
02:01:24.320 --> 02:01:26.300
unfolded with all men seeking the

3333
02:01:26.300 --> 02:01:27.140
light of the goal.

3334
02:01:27.780 --> 02:01:29.500
Then shall the brothers of light rule

3335
02:01:29.500 --> 02:01:31.600
the people. Banished shall be the

3336
02:01:31.600 --> 02:01:32.520
darkness of night.

3337
02:01:33.420 --> 02:01:35.320
Ay, the children of men shall progress

3338
02:01:35.320 --> 02:01:37.100
onward and upward to the great goal.

3339
02:01:37.660 --> 02:01:38.180
Children of

3340
02:01:38.180 --> 02:01:40.520
light shall they become. Flame of

3341
02:01:40.520 --> 02:01:42.360
the flame shall their souls ever be.

3342
02:01:43.000 --> 02:01:43.880
Knowledge and wisdom

3343
02:01:43.880 --> 02:01:45.580
shall be man's in the great age,

3344
02:01:45.760 --> 02:01:47.440
for he shall approach the eternal

3345
02:01:47.440 --> 02:01:49.360
flame, the source of all

3346
02:01:49.360 --> 02:01:52.040
wisdom, the place of beginning, that

3347
02:01:52.040 --> 02:01:53.680
is yet one with the end of

3348
02:01:53.680 --> 02:01:56.420
all things. Ay, in a time that

3349
02:01:56.420 --> 02:01:58.840
is yet unborn, all shall be one,

3350
02:01:59.280 --> 02:02:01.540
and one shall be all. Man, a

3351
02:02:01.540 --> 02:02:03.160
perfect flame of this cosmos,

3352
02:02:03.520 --> 02:02:05.260
shall move forward to a place in

3353
02:02:05.260 --> 02:02:08.020
the stars. Ay, shall move even from

3354
02:02:08.020 --> 02:02:09.240
out of the space-time

3355
02:02:09.240 --> 02:02:12.960
into another beyond the stars. Long

3356
02:02:12.960 --> 02:02:14.880
have ye listened to me, O my children.

3357
02:02:14.880 --> 02:02:17.180
Long have ye listened to the wisdom

3358
02:02:17.180 --> 02:02:19.680
of Thoth. Now I depart from ye

3359
02:02:19.680 --> 02:02:22.120
into darkness. Now go I to the

3360
02:02:22.120 --> 02:02:24.440
halls of Amenti, there to dwell in

3361
02:02:24.440 --> 02:02:26.060
the future when light shall come again

3362
02:02:26.060 --> 02:02:28.240
to man. Yet know ye my

3363
02:02:28.240 --> 02:02:30.540
spirit shall ever be with thee, guiding

3364
02:02:30.540 --> 02:02:32.420
thy feet in the pathway of light.

3365
02:02:33.340 --> 02:02:34.700
Guard ye the secrets I

3366
02:02:34.700 --> 02:02:36.840
leave with thee, and surely my spirit

3367
02:02:36.840 --> 02:02:39.160
will guard thee through life. Keep

3368
02:02:39.160 --> 02:02:40.600
thine eyes ever on the

3369
02:02:40.600 --> 02:02:42.880
pathway to wisdom. Keep the light

3370
02:02:42.880 --> 02:02:45.860
as thy goal evermore. Fetter not thy

3371
02:02:45.860 --> 02:02:47.060
soul in bondage of

3372
02:02:47.060 --> 02:02:49.620
darkness. Free let it wing in its

3373
02:02:49.620 --> 02:02:53.180
flight to the stars. Now I depart

3374
02:02:53.180 --> 02:02:54.540
thee to dwell in Amenti.

3375
02:02:54.920 --> 02:02:56.780
Be thou my children in this life

3376
02:02:56.780 --> 02:02:58.800
and the next. The time will come

3377
02:02:58.800 --> 02:03:00.460
when ye too shall be deathless,

3378
02:03:00.700 --> 02:03:02.860
living from age to age a light

3379
02:03:02.860 --> 02:03:06.160
among men. Guard ye the entrance to

3380
02:03:06.160 --> 02:03:07.260
the halls of Amenti.

3381
02:03:07.820 --> 02:03:09.700
Guard ye the secrets I have hidden

3382
02:03:09.700 --> 02:03:12.260
among ye. Let not the wisdom be

3383
02:03:12.260 --> 02:03:13.660
cast to barbarians.

3384
02:03:14.160 --> 02:03:16.300
Secrets shall thou keep it for those

3385
02:03:16.300 --> 02:03:20.320
who seek light. Now depart I. Receive

3386
02:03:20.320 --> 02:03:21.400
thou my blessing.

3387
02:03:22.260 --> 02:03:24.780
Take thou my way and follow the

3388
02:03:24.780 --> 02:03:28.080
light. Blend thou thy soul in the

3389
02:03:28.080 --> 02:03:28.900
great essence.

3390
02:03:29.340 --> 02:03:31.020
One with the great light let thy

3391
02:03:31.020 --> 02:03:33.580
consciousness be. Call thou on me

3392
02:03:33.580 --> 02:03:34.980
when thou dost need me.

3393
02:03:35.620 --> 02:03:37.940
Use my name three times in a row:
Chequetet, Arelich, Volmalites

3394
02:03:48.240 --> 02:03:50.540
Mystery, O man, hear ye the wisdom.

3395
02:03:50.800 --> 02:03:52.400
Hear ye the word that shall fill

3396
02:03:52.400 --> 02:03:53.200
thee with life.

3397
02:03:53.780 --> 02:03:55.440
Hear ye the word that shall banish

3398
02:03:55.440 --> 02:03:57.800
the darkness. Hear ye the voice that

3399
02:03:57.800 --> 02:03:58.940
shall banish the night.

3400
02:03:59.660 --> 02:04:01.080
Mystery and wisdom have I brought

3401
02:04:01.080 --> 02:04:03.200
to my children. Knowledge and power

3402
02:04:03.200 --> 02:04:04.380
descended from old.

3403
02:04:04.920 --> 02:04:06.580
Know ye not that all shall be

3404
02:04:06.580 --> 02:04:08.460
open when ye shall find the oneness

3405
02:04:08.460 --> 02:04:08.940
of all?

3406
02:04:09.720 --> 02:04:11.420
One shall ye be with the masters

3407
02:04:11.420 --> 02:04:13.800
of mystery, conquerors of death, and

3408
02:04:13.800 --> 02:04:14.800
masters of life.

3409
02:04:15.420 --> 02:04:17.220
Ay, ye shall learn of the flower

3410
02:04:17.220 --> 02:04:18.980
of Amenti, the blossom of life that

3411
02:04:18.980 --> 02:04:20.000
shines in the halls.

3412
02:04:20.680 --> 02:04:22.540
In spirit shall ye reach the halls

3413
02:04:22.540 --> 02:04:24.580
of Amenti, and bring back the wisdom

3414
02:04:24.580 --> 02:04:25.580
that liveth in light.

3415
02:04:26.360 --> 02:04:28.020
Know ye the gateway to power is

3416
02:04:28.020 --> 02:04:30.400
secret. Know ye the gateway to life

3417
02:04:30.400 --> 02:04:31.340
is through death.

3418
02:04:31.900 --> 02:04:34.000
Ay, through death, but not as ye

3419
02:04:34.000 --> 02:04:35.960
know death, but a death that is

3420
02:04:35.960 --> 02:04:38.040
life, and is fire, and is light.

3421
02:04:39.680 --> 02:04:41.680
Desireth thou to know the deep hidden

3422
02:04:41.680 --> 02:04:44.060
secret? Look in thy heart where the

3423
02:04:44.060 --> 02:04:44.940
knowledge is bound.

3424
02:04:45.400 --> 02:04:47.000
Know that in thee the secret is

3425
02:04:47.000 --> 02:04:49.360
hidden, the source of all life, and

3426
02:04:49.360 --> 02:04:50.640
the source of all death.

3427
02:04:51.480 --> 02:04:52.980
List ye, O man, while I tell

3428
02:04:52.980 --> 02:04:55.440
the secret. Reveal unto thee the secret

3429
02:04:55.440 --> 02:04:55.940
of old.

3430
02:04:56.660 --> 02:04:58.780
Deep in earth's heart lies the flower,

3431
02:04:59.260 --> 02:05:01.100
the source of the spirit that binds

3432
02:05:01.100 --> 02:05:02.120
all in its form.

3433
02:05:02.700 --> 02:05:04.520
For know ye that the earth is

3434
02:05:04.520 --> 02:05:06.540
living in body as thou art alive

3435
02:05:06.540 --> 02:05:08.220
in thine own form form.

3436
02:05:09.060 --> 02:05:11.020
The flower of life is thine own

3437
02:05:11.020 --> 02:05:13.420
place of spirit, and streams through

3438
02:05:13.420 --> 02:05:14.880
the earth as thine flows

3439
02:05:14.880 --> 02:05:17.200
through thy form, giving of life to

3440
02:05:17.200 --> 02:05:19.660
the earth and its children, renewing

3441
02:05:19.660 --> 02:05:20.880
the spirit from form

3442
02:05:20.880 --> 02:05:23.700
into form. This is the spirit that

3443
02:05:23.700 --> 02:05:25.920
is form of thy body, shaping and

3444
02:05:25.920 --> 02:05:27.380
molding into its form.

3445
02:05:28.480 --> 02:05:30.200
Know ye, O man, that thy form

3446
02:05:30.200 --> 02:05:32.700
is dual, balanced in polarity while

3447
02:05:32.700 --> 02:05:33.940
formed in its form.

3448
02:05:34.420 --> 02:05:36.000
Know that when fast on thee death

3449
02:05:36.000 --> 02:05:37.840
approaches, it is only because thy

3450
02:05:37.840 --> 02:05:38.720
balance is shaken.

3451
02:05:39.100 --> 02:05:40.820
It is only because one pole has

3452
02:05:40.820 --> 02:05:43.460
been lost. Know that thy body, when

3453
02:05:43.460 --> 02:05:44.360
in perfect balance,

3454
02:05:44.440 --> 02:05:45.880
may never be touched by the finger

3455
02:05:45.880 --> 02:05:49.140
of death. Ay, even accident may only

3456
02:05:49.140 --> 02:05:49.920
approach when the

3457
02:05:49.920 --> 02:05:52.000
balance is gone. When ye are in

3458
02:05:52.000 --> 02:05:54.280
balanced equilibrium, ye shall live

3459
02:05:54.280 --> 02:05:55.460
on in time and not

3460
02:05:55.460 --> 02:05:58.000
taste of death. Know that thou art

3461
02:05:58.000 --> 02:06:00.440
the balance completion existing because

3462
02:06:00.440 --> 02:06:01.460
of thy balance of

3463
02:06:01.460 --> 02:06:03.860
poles. As in thee one pole is

3464
02:06:03.860 --> 02:06:06.100
drawn downward, fast from thee goes

3465
02:06:06.100 --> 02:06:07.160
the balance of life.

3466
02:06:07.680 --> 02:06:09.560
Then unto thee cold death approaches,

3467
02:06:09.980 --> 02:06:12.920
and change must come to thine unbalanced life.

3468
02:06:13.780 --> 02:06:15.700
Know that the secret of life in

3469
02:06:15.700 --> 02:06:17.760
a minty is the secret of restoring

3470
02:06:17.760 --> 02:06:18.860
the balance of poles,

3471
02:06:18.860 --> 02:06:21.220
and all that exists has form and

3472
02:06:21.220 --> 02:06:23.020
is living because of the spirit of

3473
02:06:23.020 --> 02:06:24.160
life in its poles.

3474
02:06:25.160 --> 02:06:27.220
See ye not that in earth's heart

3475
02:06:27.220 --> 02:06:29.060
is the balance of all things that

3476
02:06:29.060 --> 02:06:30.940
exist and have in being on its

3477
02:06:30.940 --> 02:06:33.800
face? The source of thy spirits is

3478
02:06:33.800 --> 02:06:35.680
drawn from earth's heart, for in thy

3479
02:06:35.680 --> 02:06:36.800
form thou are one

3480
02:06:36.800 --> 02:06:39.540
with the earth. When thou hast learned

3481
02:06:39.540 --> 02:06:41.860
to hold thine own balance, then thou

3482
02:06:41.860 --> 02:06:43.040
shalt draw on the

3483
02:06:43.040 --> 02:06:45.680
balance of earth. Exist then shalt

3484
02:06:45.680 --> 02:06:48.160
thou while earth is existing, changing

3485
02:06:48.160 --> 02:06:49.820
in form, only when

3486
02:06:49.820 --> 02:06:52.680
earth too shalt change, tasting not

3487
02:06:52.680 --> 02:06:54.880
of death, but one with this planet,

3488
02:06:55.120 --> 02:06:56.820
holding thy form till all

3489
02:06:56.820 --> 02:07:00.020
pass away. List ye, old man, whilst

3490
02:07:00.020 --> 02:07:01.560
I give the secret so that ye

3491
02:07:01.560 --> 02:07:03.140
too shalt taste not of death.

3492
02:07:03.520 --> 02:07:05.520
One hour each day shalt thou lie

3493
02:07:05.520 --> 02:07:07.280
with thine head pointed to the place

3494
02:07:07.280 --> 02:07:08.360
of the positive pole,

3495
02:07:08.360 --> 02:07:11.060
north. One hour each day shalt thy

3496
02:07:11.060 --> 02:07:12.460
head be pointed to the place of

3497
02:07:12.460 --> 02:07:13.280
the negative pole,

3498
02:07:13.520 --> 02:07:16.200
south. Whilst thy head is placed to

3499
02:07:16.200 --> 02:07:18.580
the northward, hold thou thy consciousness

3500
02:07:18.580 --> 02:07:19.660
from the chest to the

3501
02:07:19.660 --> 02:07:21.840
head, and when thy head is placed

3502
02:07:21.840 --> 02:07:24.060
southward, hold thou thy thought from

3503
02:07:24.060 --> 02:07:26.320
chest to feet. Hold thou in

3504
02:07:26.320 --> 02:07:28.720
balance once in each seven, and thy

3505
02:07:28.720 --> 02:07:30.440
balance will retain the whole of its

3506
02:07:30.440 --> 02:07:32.800
strength. Ay, if thou be

3507
02:07:32.800 --> 02:07:35.140
old, thy body will freshen, and thy

3508
02:07:35.140 --> 02:07:36.840
strength will become as a youth's.

3509
02:07:37.480 --> 02:07:38.920
This is the secret known to

3510
02:07:38.920 --> 02:07:40.680
the masters by which they hold off

3511
02:07:40.680 --> 02:07:43.040
the fingers of death. Neglect not

3512
02:07:43.040 --> 02:07:44.600
to follow the path I have shown,

3513
02:07:44.900 --> 02:07:46.880
for when thou hast passed beyond years

3514
02:07:46.880 --> 02:07:48.780
to a hundred, to neglect it will

3515
02:07:48.780 --> 02:07:49.700
mean the coming of

3516
02:07:49.700 --> 02:07:52.720
death. Hear ye my words, and follow

3517
02:07:52.720 --> 02:07:55.140
the pathway. Keep thou thy balance,

3518
02:07:55.260 --> 02:07:56.380
and live on in life.

3519
02:07:56.960 --> 02:07:58.380
Hear ye, old man, and listen to

3520
02:07:58.380 --> 02:08:00.380
my voice. Listen to the wisdom that

3521
02:08:00.380 --> 02:08:01.440
gives thee of death.

3522
02:08:01.440 --> 02:08:03.340
When at the end of thy work

3523
02:08:03.340 --> 02:08:05.440
appointed, thou may desire to pass

3524
02:08:05.440 --> 02:08:06.280
from this life,

3525
02:08:06.720 --> 02:08:08.300
pass to the plain where the suns

3526
02:08:08.300 --> 02:08:10.260
of the morning live, and have being

3527
02:08:10.260 --> 02:08:12.140
as children of light. Pass

3528
02:08:12.140 --> 02:08:14.100
without pain, and pass without sorrow

3529
02:08:14.100 --> 02:08:16.680
into the plain where is eternal light.

3530
02:08:17.780 --> 02:08:20.100
First, lie at rest with thine head

3531
02:08:20.100 --> 02:08:23.180
to the eastward. Fold thou thy hands

3532
02:08:23.180 --> 02:08:24.620
at the source of thy life.

3533
02:08:25.260 --> 02:08:26.980
Place thou thy consciousness in the

3534
02:08:26.980 --> 02:08:29.620
life's seat. Whirl it, and divide

3535
02:08:29.620 --> 02:08:30.760
to north and to south.

3536
02:08:31.320 --> 02:08:33.300
Send thou the one out toward the

3537
02:08:33.300 --> 02:08:35.460
northward. Send thou the other out

3538
02:08:35.460 --> 02:08:37.240
to the south. Relax

3539
02:08:37.240 --> 02:08:40.280
thou their hold upon thy being. Forth,

3540
02:08:40.400 --> 02:08:43.180
from thy form, will thy silver spark fly,

3541
02:08:43.640 --> 02:08:45.260
upward and onward to the sun of

3542
02:08:45.260 --> 02:08:46.780
the morning, blending with light,

3543
02:08:47.160 --> 02:08:48.360
at one with its source.

3544
02:08:49.020 --> 02:08:51.220
There it shall flame till desire shall

3545
02:08:51.220 --> 02:08:53.900
be created. Then shall return to a

3546
02:08:53.900 --> 02:08:54.880
place in a form,

3547
02:08:54.880 --> 02:08:57.500
know ye, old man, that thus pass

3548
02:08:57.500 --> 02:08:59.800
the great souls, changing at will

3549
02:08:59.800 --> 02:09:01.120
from life unto life.

3550
02:09:01.600 --> 02:09:04.120
Thus ever passes the avatar, willing

3551
02:09:04.120 --> 02:09:06.520
his death as he wills his own life.

3552
02:09:07.640 --> 02:09:09.340
List ye, old man, drink of my

3553
02:09:09.340 --> 02:09:11.420
wisdom. Learn ye the secret that is

3554
02:09:11.420 --> 02:09:12.440
master of time.

3555
02:09:12.720 --> 02:09:14.480
Learn ye how those ye call masters

3556
02:09:14.480 --> 02:09:16.520
are able to remember the lives of

3557
02:09:16.520 --> 02:09:17.080
the past.

3558
02:09:17.700 --> 02:09:19.620
Great is the secret yet easy to

3559
02:09:19.620 --> 02:09:21.440
master, giving to thee the mastery

3560
02:09:21.440 --> 02:09:22.040
of time.

3561
02:09:22.040 --> 02:09:24.600
When upon thee death fast approaches,

3562
02:09:25.080 --> 02:09:26.720
fear not, but know ye are master

3563
02:09:26.720 --> 02:09:27.300
of death.

3564
02:09:27.680 --> 02:09:30.400
Relax thy body. Resist not with tension.

3565
02:09:31.000 --> 02:09:32.460
Place in thy heart the flame of

3566
02:09:32.460 --> 02:09:33.040
thy soul.

3567
02:09:33.720 --> 02:09:35.460
Swiftly then sweep it to the seat

3568
02:09:35.460 --> 02:09:37.620
of the triangle. Hold for a moment,

3569
02:09:37.900 --> 02:09:39.180
then move to the goal.

3570
02:09:39.840 --> 02:09:41.960
This, thy goal, is the place between

3571
02:09:41.960 --> 02:09:43.820
thine eyebrows, the place where the

3572
02:09:43.820 --> 02:09:44.540
memory of life

3573
02:09:44.540 --> 02:09:47.380
must hold sway. Hold thou thy flame

3574
02:09:47.380 --> 02:09:49.100
here in thy brain-seat until the

3575
02:09:49.100 --> 02:09:50.700
fingers of death grasp thy

3576
02:09:50.700 --> 02:09:53.680
soul. Then, as thou pass through the

3577
02:09:53.680 --> 02:09:55.580
state of transition, surely the memories

3578
02:09:55.580 --> 02:09:56.240
of life shall

3579
02:09:56.240 --> 02:09:58.840
pass too. Then shall the past be

3580
02:09:58.840 --> 02:10:00.740
as one with the present. Then shall

3581
02:10:00.740 --> 02:10:02.280
the memory of all be retained.

3582
02:10:02.940 --> 02:10:05.200
Free shalt thou be from all retrogression.

3583
02:10:05.740 --> 02:10:07.400
The things of the past shall live

3584
02:10:07.400 --> 02:10:07.980
in to-day.

3585
02:10:08.620 --> 02:10:11.320
Man, ye have heard the voice of

3586
02:10:11.320 --> 02:10:14.340
my wisdom. Follow, and ye shall live

3587
02:10:14.340 --> 02:10:16.040
through the ages as I.

3588
02:10:21.920 --> 02:10:23.900
List ye, O man, to the deep

3589
02:10:23.900 --> 02:10:26.160
hidden wisdom lost to the world since

3590
02:10:26.160 --> 02:10:27.480
the time of the dwellers,

3591
02:10:27.720 --> 02:10:29.660
lost and forgotten by men of this

3592
02:10:29.660 --> 02:10:32.460
age. Know ye this earth is but

3593
02:10:32.460 --> 02:10:34.080
a portal guarded by powers

3594
02:10:34.080 --> 02:10:37.040
unknown to man. Yet, the dark lords

3595
02:10:37.040 --> 02:10:38.920
hide the entrance that leads to the

3596
02:10:38.920 --> 02:10:40.020
heaven-born land.

3597
02:10:40.520 --> 02:10:42.140
Know ye the way to the sphere

3598
02:10:42.140 --> 02:10:44.380
of Arulu is guarded by barriers opened

3599
02:10:44.380 --> 02:10:46.160
only to light-born man.

3600
02:10:46.880 --> 02:10:48.960
Upon earth I am the holder of

3601
02:10:48.960 --> 02:10:50.420
the keys to the gates of the

3602
02:10:50.420 --> 02:10:51.220
sacred land.

3603
02:10:51.640 --> 02:10:53.640
Command I by the powers beyond me

3604
02:10:53.640 --> 02:10:55.080
to leave the keys to the world

3605
02:10:55.080 --> 02:10:55.660
of man.

3606
02:10:56.160 --> 02:10:58.060
Before I depart I give ye the

3607
02:10:58.060 --> 02:10:59.820
secrets of how ye may rise from

3608
02:10:59.820 --> 02:11:00.900
the bondage of darkness.

3609
02:11:00.900 --> 02:11:03.060
Cast off the fetters of flesh that

3610
02:11:03.060 --> 02:11:05.280
have bound ye. Rise from the darkness

3611
02:11:05.280 --> 02:11:06.220
into the light.

3612
02:11:06.840 --> 02:11:08.960
Know ye the soul must be cleansed

3613
02:11:08.960 --> 02:11:11.300
of its darkness. Ere ye may enter

3614
02:11:11.300 --> 02:11:12.340
the portals of light.

3615
02:11:12.940 --> 02:11:15.220
Thus I established among ye the mysteries

3616
02:11:15.220 --> 02:11:17.280
so that the secrets may always be found.

3617
02:11:17.960 --> 02:11:20.080
Ay, though man may fall into darkness,

3618
02:11:20.500 --> 02:11:22.600
always the light will shine as a guide.

3619
02:11:23.220 --> 02:11:25.600
Hidden in darkness, veiled in symbols,

3620
02:11:25.900 --> 02:11:27.460
always the way to the portal will

3621
02:11:27.460 --> 02:11:28.000
be found.

3622
02:11:28.000 --> 02:11:30.220
Man in the future will deny the

3623
02:11:30.220 --> 02:11:32.700
mysteries, but always the way the

3624
02:11:32.700 --> 02:11:33.700
seeker will find.

3625
02:11:34.820 --> 02:11:37.100
Now I command ye to maintain my

3626
02:11:37.100 --> 02:11:40.380
secrets, giving only to those ye have tested,

3627
02:11:40.580 --> 02:11:41.860
so that the pure may not be

3628
02:11:41.860 --> 02:11:44.140
corrupted, so that the power of truth

3629
02:11:44.140 --> 02:11:44.880
may prevail.

3630
02:11:45.440 --> 02:11:47.240
List ye now to the unveiling of

3631
02:11:47.240 --> 02:11:49.600
mystery. List to the symbols of mystery

3632
02:11:49.600 --> 02:11:50.260
I give.

3633
02:11:50.800 --> 02:11:52.260
Make of it a religion, for only

3634
02:11:52.260 --> 02:11:53.900
thus will its essence remain.

3635
02:11:54.900 --> 02:11:56.740
Regions there are, too, between this

3636
02:11:56.740 --> 02:11:57.760
life and the Great One,

3637
02:11:58.080 --> 02:11:59.780
travelled by the souls who depart

3638
02:11:59.780 --> 02:12:00.640
from this earth.

3639
02:12:01.240 --> 02:12:02.980
Do it, the home of the powers

3640
02:12:02.980 --> 02:12:06.260
of illusion. Seek Het Hetspet, the

3641
02:12:06.260 --> 02:12:07.240
house of the gods.

3642
02:12:07.860 --> 02:12:09.660
Osiris, the symbol of the god of

3643
02:12:09.660 --> 02:12:11.620
the portal, who turns back the souls

3644
02:12:11.620 --> 02:12:12.600
of unworthy men.

3645
02:12:13.200 --> 02:12:15.340
Beyond lies the sphere of the heaven

3646
02:12:15.340 --> 02:12:16.180
-born powers,

3647
02:12:16.480 --> 02:12:18.500
Arulu, the land where the Great Ones

3648
02:12:18.500 --> 02:12:19.160
have passed.

3649
02:12:19.160 --> 02:12:21.920
There, when my work among men has

3650
02:12:21.920 --> 02:12:24.340
finished, I will join the Great Ones

3651
02:12:24.340 --> 02:12:25.420
of my ancient home.

3652
02:12:26.440 --> 02:12:28.280
Seven are the mansions of the house

3653
02:12:28.280 --> 02:12:28.800
of the mighty.

3654
02:12:29.320 --> 02:12:31.260
Three guards the portal of each house

3655
02:12:31.260 --> 02:12:31.980
from the darkness.

3656
02:12:32.660 --> 02:12:34.400
Fifteen the ways that lead to the

3657
02:12:34.400 --> 02:12:36.520
do-it. Twelve are the houses of

3658
02:12:36.520 --> 02:12:37.400
the lords of illusion,

3659
02:12:37.640 --> 02:12:39.540
facing four ways, each of them different.

3660
02:12:40.280 --> 02:12:41.800
Forty and two are the great powers

3661
02:12:41.800 --> 02:12:42.780
judging the dead,

3662
02:12:43.120 --> 02:12:45.300
who seek for the portal. Four are

3663
02:12:45.300 --> 02:12:46.340
the sons of Horus.

3664
02:12:46.340 --> 02:12:48.220
Two are the guards of the east

3665
02:12:48.220 --> 02:12:49.220
and west of Isis,

3666
02:12:49.500 --> 02:12:51.220
the mother who pleads for her children,

3667
02:12:51.700 --> 02:12:53.740
queen of the moon, reflecting the sun.

3668
02:12:54.660 --> 02:12:56.820
Ba is the essence, living forever.

3669
02:12:57.620 --> 02:12:59.500
Ka is the shadow that man knows

3670
02:12:59.500 --> 02:13:00.100
as life.

3671
02:13:00.680 --> 02:13:03.220
Ba cometh not until Ka is incarnate.

3672
02:13:03.760 --> 02:13:05.540
These are mysteries to preserve through

3673
02:13:05.540 --> 02:13:06.120
the ages.

3674
02:13:06.880 --> 02:13:08.740
Keys are they of life and of death.

3675
02:13:09.520 --> 02:13:11.160
Hear ye now the mystery of mysteries.

3676
02:13:11.900 --> 02:13:12.780
Learn of the circle,

3677
02:13:12.780 --> 02:13:14.840
beginningless and endless, the form

3678
02:13:14.840 --> 02:13:17.040
of He who is one and in all.

3679
02:13:17.860 --> 02:13:20.160
Listen and hear it. Go forth and

3680
02:13:20.160 --> 02:13:20.760
apply it.

3681
02:13:21.600 --> 02:13:23.220
Thus will ye travel the way that

3682
02:13:23.220 --> 02:13:25.800
I go. Mystery and mystery, yet clear

3683
02:13:25.800 --> 02:13:26.660
to the light-born,

3684
02:13:26.940 --> 02:13:28.940
the secret of all I now will

3685
02:13:28.940 --> 02:13:31.880
reveal. I will declare a secret to

3686
02:13:31.880 --> 02:13:32.580
the initiated,

3687
02:13:33.080 --> 02:13:34.620
but let the door be wholly shut

3688
02:13:34.620 --> 02:13:35.800
against the profane.

3689
02:13:37.160 --> 02:13:39.640
Three is the mystery come from the

3690
02:13:39.640 --> 02:13:41.740
Great One. Here and light on thee

3691
02:13:41.740 --> 02:13:42.360
will dawn.

3692
02:13:42.780 --> 02:13:45.520
In the primeval dwell three unities.

3693
02:13:46.060 --> 02:13:47.820
Other than these, none can exist.

3694
02:13:48.500 --> 02:13:50.340
These are the equilibrium, source

3695
02:13:50.340 --> 02:13:54.260
of creation. One God, one truth, one

3696
02:13:54.260 --> 02:13:54.980
point of freedom.

3697
02:13:55.820 --> 02:13:57.620
Three come forth from the three of

3698
02:13:57.620 --> 02:14:00.480
the balance, all life, all good, all power.

3699
02:14:01.360 --> 02:14:03.200
Three are the qualities of God in

3700
02:14:03.200 --> 02:14:06.020
His light home. Infinite power, infinite

3701
02:14:06.020 --> 02:14:07.480
wisdom, infinite love.

3702
02:14:08.360 --> 02:14:10.020
There are the powers given to the

3703
02:14:10.020 --> 02:14:12.440
masters, to transmute evil, assist

3704
02:14:12.440 --> 02:14:14.380
good, use discrimination.

3705
02:14:15.240 --> 02:14:16.960
Three are the things inevitable for

3706
02:14:16.960 --> 02:14:19.680
God to perform, manifest power, wisdom,

3707
02:14:19.960 --> 02:14:20.520
and love.

3708
02:14:21.020 --> 02:14:23.000
Three are the powers creating all

3709
02:14:23.000 --> 02:14:26.340
things. Divine love possessed of perfect knowledge.

3710
02:14:27.000 --> 02:14:29.620
Divine wisdom knowing all possible means.

3711
02:14:30.180 --> 02:14:32.760
Divine power possessed by the joint

3712
02:14:32.760 --> 02:14:34.500
will of divine love and wisdom.

3713
02:14:35.300 --> 02:14:37.360
Three are the circles of existence.

3714
02:14:37.760 --> 02:14:39.640
The circle of light where dwells nothing

3715
02:14:39.640 --> 02:14:40.220
but God,

3716
02:14:40.680 --> 02:14:42.880
and only God can transverse it. The

3717
02:14:42.880 --> 02:14:44.660
circle of chaos where all things by

3718
02:14:44.660 --> 02:14:46.000
nature arise from death.

3719
02:14:46.460 --> 02:14:48.020
And the circle of awareness where

3720
02:14:48.020 --> 02:14:49.500
all things spring from life.

3721
02:14:50.280 --> 02:14:52.520
All things animate are of the three

3722
02:14:52.520 --> 02:14:53.500
states of existence.

3723
02:14:54.220 --> 02:14:56.660
Chaos or death, liberty in humanity,

3724
02:14:57.040 --> 02:14:58.360
and felicity of heaven.

3725
02:14:59.620 --> 02:15:02.400
Three necessities control all things,

3726
02:15:02.760 --> 02:15:04.880
beginning in the great deep, the circle

3727
02:15:04.880 --> 02:15:07.020
of chaos, plentitude in heaven.

3728
02:15:07.840 --> 02:15:09.640
Three are the paths of the soul,

3729
02:15:10.240 --> 02:15:11.680
man, liberty, light.

3730
02:15:12.700 --> 02:15:15.040
Three are the hindrances, lack of

3731
02:15:15.040 --> 02:15:17.200
endeavor to obtain knowledge, non

3732
02:15:17.200 --> 02:15:19.980
-attachment to God, attachment to evil.

3733
02:15:20.840 --> 02:15:24.080
In man, the three are manifest. Three

3734
02:15:24.080 --> 02:15:25.500
are the kings of power within.

3735
02:15:26.180 --> 02:15:28.100
Three are the chambers of the mysteries,

3736
02:15:28.380 --> 02:15:30.120
found yet not found in the body

3737
02:15:30.120 --> 02:15:30.600
of man.

3738
02:15:55.500 --> 02:15:56.660
In the revolution of the heavens,

3739
02:15:57.200 --> 02:15:59.240
they bathe in the fountains of light.

3740
02:16:27.020 --> 02:16:28.960
Shattered fourth from the feet of

3741
02:16:28.960 --> 02:16:30.940
his throne like the diamond rolled

3742
02:16:30.940 --> 02:16:32.860
forth four rivers of flame from

3743
02:16:32.860 --> 02:16:35.040
his footstool rolled through the channels

3744
02:16:35.040 --> 02:16:37.820
of clouds to the man world filled

3745
02:16:37.820 --> 02:16:38.760
was the hall with

3746
02:16:38.760 --> 02:16:41.180
spirits of heaven wonder of wonders

3747
02:16:41.180 --> 02:16:43.920
was the starry palace above the sky

3748
02:16:43.920 --> 02:16:45.400
like a rainbow of fire and

3749
02:16:45.400 --> 02:16:48.060
sunlight were formed the spirits saying

3750
02:16:48.060 --> 02:16:49.720
they the glories of the holy one

3751
02:16:49.720 --> 02:16:51.680
then from the midst of the

3752
02:16:51.680 --> 02:16:54.640
fire came a voice behold the glory

3753
02:16:54.640 --> 02:16:57.240
of the first calls i beheld that

3754
02:16:57.240 --> 02:16:59.060
light high above all darkness

3755
02:16:59.060 --> 02:17:01.860
reflected in my own being i attained

3756
02:17:01.860 --> 02:17:03.660
as it were to the god of

3757
02:17:03.660 --> 02:17:06.400
all gods the spirit sun the sovereign

3758
02:17:06.400 --> 02:17:09.920
of the sun's fears again came the

3759
02:17:09.920 --> 02:17:12.620
voice there is one even the first

3760
02:17:12.620 --> 02:17:14.400
who hath no beginning who hath

3761
02:17:14.400 --> 02:17:16.720
no end who hath made all things

3762
02:17:16.720 --> 02:17:18.960
who govern all who is good who

3763
02:17:18.960 --> 02:17:21.920
is just who illumines who sustains

3764
02:17:22.540 --> 02:17:24.940
then from the throne there poured

3765
02:17:24.940 --> 02:17:26.920
a great radiance surrounding and lifting

3766
02:17:26.920 --> 02:17:28.280
my soul by its power

3767
02:17:28.960 --> 02:17:30.660
swiftly i moved through the spaces

3768
02:17:30.660 --> 02:17:32.880
of heaven shown was i the mystery

3769
02:17:32.880 --> 02:17:34.680
of mysteries shown the secret

3770
02:17:34.680 --> 02:17:37.500
heart of the cosmos carried was i

3771
02:17:37.500 --> 02:17:39.660
to the land of arulu stood before

3772
02:17:39.660 --> 02:17:40.980
the lords in their houses

3773
02:17:40.980 --> 02:17:43.340
opened they the doorway so that i

3774
02:17:43.340 --> 02:17:46.260
might glimpse the primeval chaos shuddered

3775
02:17:46.260 --> 02:17:47.320
my soul to the vision

3776
02:17:47.320 --> 02:17:49.420
of horror shrank back my soul from

3777
02:17:49.420 --> 02:17:52.000
the ocean of darkness then saw i

3778
02:17:52.000 --> 02:17:53.920
the need for the barriers saw

3779
02:17:53.920 --> 02:17:55.520
the need for the lords of arulu

3780
02:17:55.520 --> 02:17:58.160
only they with their infinite balance

3781
02:17:58.160 --> 02:17:59.360
could stand in the way

3782
02:17:59.360 --> 02:18:02.180
of the inpouring chaos only they could

3783
02:18:02.180 --> 02:18:05.680
guard god's creation then did i pass

3784
02:18:05.680 --> 02:18:06.860
around the circle of eight

3785
02:18:06.860 --> 02:18:09.160
saw all the souls who had conquered

3786
02:18:09.160 --> 02:18:11.960
the darkness saw the splendor of light

3787
02:18:11.960 --> 02:18:12.980
where they dwelled

3788
02:18:13.940 --> 02:18:15.900
long died to take my place in

3789
02:18:15.900 --> 02:18:17.920
their circle but longed i also for

3790
02:18:17.920 --> 02:18:18.940
the way i had chosen

3791
02:18:18.940 --> 02:18:20.800
when i stood in the halls of

3792
02:18:20.800 --> 02:18:22.400
aminti and made my choice to the

3793
02:18:22.400 --> 02:18:23.260
work i would do

3794
02:18:23.820 --> 02:18:25.580
passed i from the halls of arulu

3795
02:18:25.580 --> 02:18:27.200
down to the earth space where my

3796
02:18:27.200 --> 02:18:27.840
body lay

3797
02:18:27.840 --> 02:18:30.040
arose i from the earth where i

3798
02:18:30.040 --> 02:18:32.240
rested stood i before the dweller

3799
02:18:32.240 --> 02:18:34.280
gave my pledge to renounce

3800
02:18:34.280 --> 02:18:36.300
my great right until my work on

3801
02:18:36.300 --> 02:18:38.400
earth was completed until the age

so the profane will

3812
02:18:57.440 --> 02:19:00.120
laugh and renounce in every land form

3813
02:19:00.120 --> 02:19:02.300
