1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.180
Happiness is a trap and most people

2
00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:04.060
waste their entire lives chasing it.

3
00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:06.320
As today's guest says, happiness is

4
00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:08.200
a direction, not a destination.

5
00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:10.060
And the real destination you should

6
00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:11.760
be chasing is far more interesting

7
00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:13.580
and potent than mere happiness.

8
00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:15.640
So join me today with Arthur Brooks

9
00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:17.560
as we explore the joys of an

10
00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:18.480
honorable life

11
00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.200
lived in pursuit of pleasure, power,

12
00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:22.840
and success instead.

13
00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.600
Why is it a trap to think

14
00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:28.260
that you can be happy?

15
00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.680
Because happiness is not a destination.

16
00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:32.500
Happiness is a direction.

17
00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.060
Happiness is the idea that you can

18
00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:36.440
be blissful and happy all the time.

19
00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.100
It's not just unrealistic, it's unhealthy.

20
00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:41.340
It would be terrible if you were

21
00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:42.140
happy all the time.

22
00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:43.820
You'd be eaten by a tiger immediately.

23
00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:49.140
You'd have no negative feelings which

24
00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:49.940
keep you alive.

25
00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:51.800
I mean, the idea of the limbic

26
00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.300
system of your brain that's producing

27
00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:54.700
sadness and anger and

28
00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:58.100
disgust and fear, these are the emotions

29
00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:59.220
that have kept you alive.

30
00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:01.400
Mere Pleistocene ancestors would have

31
00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:02.720
been eaten by an animal immediately.

32
00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:03.920
You'd be run over by a car.

33
00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:06.100
You need these things that actually

34
00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:07.940
make you at least temporarily unhappy

35
00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:08.880
or you can't put

36
00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:09.980
one foot in front of the other.

37
00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:12.300
Therefore, happiness is the wrong goal.

38
00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:13.880
The right goal is happier.

39
00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:16.340
So that's really what we're trying

40
00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.640
to do.

41
00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.380
And to get happier is a process

42
00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:19.540
all throughout your life.

43
00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:22.980
And to be on the path toward

44
00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:25.720
what Oprah Winfrey calls happierness,

45
00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:28.480
you actually need a system that makes

46
00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:30.580
it possible so that you can pursue

47
00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:31.500
it and you need to pursue

48
00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:31.620
it.

49
00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:32.920
The reason people need to watch Impact

50
00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:34.540
Theory, by the way, is because this

51
00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:35.420
is a pursuit of

52
00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:36.300
happiness show.

53
00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.280
This is all about pursuit.

54
00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:40.180
This is all about achievement.

55
00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:41.240
It's about trying.

56
00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:42.780
It's about making your life better.

57
00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:44.360
It's about progress.

58
00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:46.380
This is one of the most important

59
00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:47.860
points of human flourishing.

60
00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:49.060
This is about progress.

61
00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:51.720
People often ask, why is it so

62
00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.960
relatively easy to lose weight but

63
00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:55.040
impossible to keep it off?

64
00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.100
It's because when the scale goes down

65
00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:59.380
each day, it gives you this incredible reward.

66
00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.180
But when you hit your goal, the

67
00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:02.660
reward is never eating anything you

68
00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:03.280
like ever again

69
00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:04.300
for the rest of your life.

70
00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:06.900
Everything in life is progress.

71
00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.000
And that's why the pursuit matters

72
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.680
so that you can actually be on

73
00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:11.720
the trail toward

74
00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:13.100
happierness.

75
00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:14.300
And that's the right goal for all

76
00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.620
of us.

77
00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:15.580
It's really interesting.

78
00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:16.620
I like that a lot.

79
00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:18.520
I think a lot about the traps.

80
00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:20.580
So when I think about what Impact

81
00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.000
Theory is and what I'm trying to

82
00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.420
make it,

83
00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:25.200
it started out pretty simplistic.

84
00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:28.420
So we're in phase three of Impact

85
00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:30.720
Theory at this point, because it's

86
00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:31.680
really me trying

87
00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.320
to figure out, okay, how do you

88
00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:35.340
get out of the spiritual entertainment

89
00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:36.360
and into the real

90
00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.160
thing that people need to actually

91
00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.060
do and understand in order to make

92
00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:40.840
progress, in order

93
00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:42.480
to be happier, in order to be

94
00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.000
more fulfilled is how I think about it.

95
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.400
Um, but the way that people get

96
00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:49.340
trapped is very counterintuitive to me.

97
00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:50.940
And you're the only person that I've

98
00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:52.400
ever heard bring it up.

99
00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:54.360
I don't know if you consider it

100
00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.060
the central thesis, but you've talked

101
00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:56.660
about how people

102
00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:58.080
get stuck in their perceptions.

103
00:02:58.480 --> 00:02:58.920
Yeah.

104
00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:01.960
And that to me is very interesting.

105
00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.020
And there's really, I think, two ways

106
00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:05.900
that people get stuck by their perceptions.

107
00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:09.160
One is they confuse them with objective reality.

108
00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:10.880
So they just think, oh, the thing

109
00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:12.320
I believe is true.

110
00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:12.720
Right.

111
00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.620
And so if you don't believe it,

112
00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:16.160
you just don't see the truth.

113
00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:18.180
And then the other way that people

114
00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:20.300
get trapped by perception is they

115
00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:21.760
identify themselves with

116
00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:21.900
it.

117
00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:23.880
And so they love that they are

118
00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:25.640
on the left or the right.

119
00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:27.940
And so you end up with this

120
00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:30.920
vicious cycle of, I'm proud that I

121
00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:32.300
have recognized the truth.

122
00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:35.400
And I feel good about myself for

123
00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:36.900
noticing how wrong you are.

124
00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:38.460
And so we end up in a

125
00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:39.960
pretty gnarly situation where they're

126
00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:40.800
not actually happy.

127
00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:42.020
That's the freaky thing.

128
00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:45.460
So how do people begin to unwind that?

129
00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:47.340
Well, there's a lot.

130
00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:48.320
There's a lot.

131
00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:49.600
I mean, I agree with everything you

132
00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:51.000
said, but there's so much in what

133
00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:51.760
you said, too, that

134
00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:55.420
helps us understand the bad situation

135
00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:57.120
or the conundrum that our country

136
00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:57.820
is in, the world

137
00:03:57.820 --> 00:03:58.180
is in.

138
00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:59.640
And it has everything to do with

139
00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:02.740
our inability to stop seeing ourselves

140
00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:04.740
in terms of the things

141
00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:05.400
that we think.

142
00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:07.860
This is a classic kind of attachment.

143
00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:09.580
So Buddhists talk about this a lot.

144
00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:11.240
So Thich Nhat Hanh, the great Vietnamese

145
00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:12.860
Buddhist monk who, you know, one of

146
00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:14.040
the most important

147
00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:16.540
Buddhist teachers of the last 50 years

148
00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:17.660
died just a couple of years ago.

149
00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:19.140
And he used to talk about the

150
00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:20.480
worst kind of attachments that we

151
00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:21.300
have in modern life is

152
00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:24.140
the attachment to our views, the attachments

153
00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:25.280
to what we think.

154
00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:26.880
That's just as bad as being attached

155
00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:28.620
to your watch, your car, your television

156
00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:29.100
to say, you

157
00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:31.540
know, I love my, I love my car.

158
00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:32.740
I mean, what's wrong with you?

159
00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:33.620
I love your car.

160
00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:34.280
It's a thing.

161
00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:36.660
You shouldn't, you only use things

162
00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:37.840
and you only love people.

163
00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:39.940
I mean, that's an iron law of happiness.

164
00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:41.880
But the thing is that we do

165
00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:43.480
a version of this ideologically where

166
00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:45.460
we say that we're

167
00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:47.360
so identified with the things that

168
00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:48.800
we think that it becomes an attachment

169
00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:49.440
that it becomes

170
00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:51.600
almost a love attachment in our lives.

171
00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:53.560
Now, that's really alienating.

172
00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:55.360
That's incredibly alienating because

173
00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:57.260
you are not your views and I

174
00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:58.100
am not mine.

175
00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:00.380
And that's incredibly important for

176
00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:01.620
us to be able to learn for

177
00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:02.600
this pursuit of happiness

178
00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:04.540
for progress in and of itself is

179
00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:06.060
to not be the things that we

180
00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:07.120
think and to recognize

181
00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:09.960
that we think many things that are wrong.

182
00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:11.440
We just don't know which they are.

183
00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:13.580
The reason people watch this show

184
00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:15.700
and listen to this show is because

185
00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:16.680
they want to learn

186
00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:19.060
more so they can update their views,

187
00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:20.660
which is an acknowledgement that their

188
00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:21.140
views weren't

189
00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:22.340
perfect to begin with, that their

190
00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:23.740
knowledge wasn't perfect to begin with.

191
00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:26.100
Now, when you're being taught by a

192
00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:29.800
baby boomer culture warriors that

193
00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:30.200
are trying to

194
00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:32.280
conscript child soldiers into their

195
00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:34.540
culture war, they will say, if you

196
00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:35.400
don't think these

197
00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:37.180
things, something is morally defective

198
00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:37.720
about you.

199
00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:39.360
And you will have the perfect truth.

200
00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:42.080
You will have the secret Gnostic truths

201
00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:43.620
if you do believe these things.

202
00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:45.560
And at that point, our beliefs, including

203
00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:46.820
political beliefs, have just become

204
00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:47.360
a religion.

205
00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:49.120
They've just become a cult.

206
00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:51.180
And that's really what we see.

207
00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:53.100
And so people are inducted into these

208
00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:54.620
competing cults all the time.

209
00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:56.760
And I have a traditional religion

210
00:05:56.760 --> 00:06:00.020
and I identify with my religion, but

211
00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:00.560
I don't know if I'm

212
00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:00.840
right.

213
00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:02.600
Even on that, I don't know the

214
00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:04.360
things that are right.

215
00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:05.920
And that's been incredibly freeing

216
00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:06.220
for me.

217
00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:07.440
And that's ultimately what we all

218
00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:08.180
have to acknowledge.

219
00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:11.100
I think these things, but I'm willing

220
00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:14.320
to be corrected if I get better information.

221
00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:15.420
And the only way I'm going to

222
00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:16.440
do that is to go to people

223
00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:17.860
who disagree with me, people

224
00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:20.000
who think differently than me, people

225
00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
who threaten my preconceived notions

226
00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:22.620
and, and

227
00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:23.580
to take it in and say, you

228
00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:24.960
disagree with me, Tom, come sit next

229
00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:25.680
to me, man.

230
00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:26.560
I got to hear it.

231
00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:28.020
Why is that freeing?

232
00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:30.280
Why is it freeing to acknowledge that

233
00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:32.660
you almost certainly are wrong and

234
00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:34.340
to invite people

235
00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:35.700
to challenge those ideas?

236
00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:38.160
For most people that that's like arresting.

237
00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:38.420
Yeah.

238
00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:39.460
Well, that's a hard thing to do

239
00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:40.800
because that actually goes against

240
00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:41.520
that, that, that,

241
00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:43.040
that contravenes evolution.

242
00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:46.580
Evolution is, tells us that we need

243
00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:49.040
to believe particular things and to

244
00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:49.720
defend them.

245
00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:51.580
And the ego threats are actually dangerous

246
00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:53.080
to us because if, you know, if

247
00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:53.960
we're, if we

248
00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:55.740
show ourselves to be wrong to others,

249
00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:57.320
then that makes us look incompetent.

250
00:06:57.320 --> 00:06:58.700
Then we're less likely to survive.

251
00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:00.480
We're less likely to thrive in a community.

252
00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:02.420
We're less likely to rise in a hierarchy.

253
00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:04.180
We're less likely to find mates.

254
00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:05.920
And so the result is that you

255
00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:08.220
defend, defend, defend, defend, but

256
00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:09.240
we don't have to do that.

257
00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:11.460
That's hugely maladapted in modern

258
00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:13.620
life, particularly with modern technology.

259
00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:15.000
I mean, think of the technology that

260
00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.140
we're using right now to record this

261
00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:18.000
show and that

262
00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:19.680
people are using to watch us right now.

263
00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:22.180
That's an updating learning technology.

264
00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:23.940
And if you're stuck in the static,

265
00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:27.180
the stasis of, of here's this body

266
00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:28.100
of information that

267
00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:29.560
I have, and it must all be right.

268
00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:31.500
You've basically said that you can't

269
00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:32.740
grow and learn.

270
00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:35.860
So you have to relax that evolutionary imperative.

271
00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:38.040
You have to fight back against what

272
00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:39.800
mother nature is putting into you.

273
00:07:40.140 --> 00:07:41.200
That's in, you know, this is the

274
00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:42.340
way that philosophers will always

275
00:07:42.340 --> 00:07:42.980
talk about sort of

276
00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:44.680
the animal path and the divine path.

277
00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:46.900
The animal path is going according

278
00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:48.200
to your evolutionary imperatives.

279
00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:49.400
These are the things that I, it's

280
00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:51.120
like, if it feels good, do it.

281
00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:52.620
The best way to ruin your life.

282
00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:55.500
The divine path is to stand up

283
00:07:55.500 --> 00:07:57.020
to the things that feel unnatural.

284
00:07:57.660 --> 00:07:58.640
You know, we do this all the time.

285
00:07:58.720 --> 00:07:59.520
I mean, you and I work out

286
00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:00.660
every day, right?

287
00:08:00.660 --> 00:08:04.480
And, and that's, it's the, the nature's

288
00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:06.840
path is sit on the couch, right?

289
00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:10.020
Nature's path is eat that sweet thing, right?

290
00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:11.840
And, and the divine path is to

291
00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:14.100
do things that are hard, that don't

292
00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:15.040
feel natural because

293
00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:17.320
you know, you're, you're, you've been

294
00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:20.080
given a prefrontal cortex where you

295
00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:20.820
can make conscious

296
00:08:20.820 --> 00:08:22.780
decisions that are better than what,

297
00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:24.840
what your feelings tell you that they

298
00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:25.340
should be.

299
00:08:25.580 --> 00:08:27.900
So mother nature says, defend your

300
00:08:27.900 --> 00:08:29.860
opinions at all costs, because if

301
00:08:29.860 --> 00:08:30.420
you don't, it's

302
00:08:30.420 --> 00:08:31.580
an ego threat and they could have,

303
00:08:31.940 --> 00:08:33.040
you know, could have catastrophic

304
00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:34.240
consequences for your

305
00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:35.240
position in the hierarchy.

306
00:08:35.820 --> 00:08:37.980
But you know, that if you don't

307
00:08:37.980 --> 00:08:40.640
defend your positions, if you admit

308
00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:41.420
to the possibility

309
00:08:41.420 --> 00:08:42.820
that you're not right, that you learn

310
00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:43.600
and you update.

311
00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:44.720
And when people say things that you

312
00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:46.960
think are crazy, you say, tell me

313
00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:48.160
more, that you're

314
00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:49.440
actually going to get better.

315
00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:51.380
And that's a conscious decision.

316
00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:52.500
Yeah.

317
00:08:52.620 --> 00:08:54.040
So one, the fact that it's a

318
00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:55.440
conscious decision, I think is really

319
00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:56.240
important for people.

320
00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:57.460
Something you talk about in the book

321
00:08:57.460 --> 00:08:59.720
that when people have collision of

322
00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:00.420
values, they

323
00:09:00.420 --> 00:09:02.400
can really run into a problem.

324
00:09:02.860 --> 00:09:04.440
One of the things, going back to

325
00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:05.980
the question I was asking, one of

326
00:09:05.980 --> 00:09:06.620
the things that I think

327
00:09:06.620 --> 00:09:08.300
really causes problems for people

328
00:09:08.300 --> 00:09:10.320
is they have a value system.

329
00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:12.620
They've never articulated it to themselves.

330
00:09:12.620 --> 00:09:14.260
They've never documented it, written

331
00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:14.540
it down.

332
00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:16.380
So they know these are my actual values.

333
00:09:16.860 --> 00:09:20.700
And then they don't realize that those

334
00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:21.140
are choices.

335
00:09:21.340 --> 00:09:22.520
Again, they're mistaking them for,

336
00:09:22.740 --> 00:09:24.320
this is how the world ought to be.

337
00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:27.300
And when they collide with other people,

338
00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:29.280
they just assume you don't recognize

339
00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:29.600
the way the

340
00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:30.180
world ought to be.

341
00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:31.380
You are bad.

342
00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:32.420
You're a moron, whatever.

343
00:09:32.660 --> 00:09:34.260
And now you get these conflicts.

344
00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:36.320
And you said in the book that

345
00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:39.840
families break up because, you didn't

346
00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:40.960
say collision of values,

347
00:09:41.060 --> 00:09:43.380
but that's how I read it to mean.

348
00:09:43.780 --> 00:09:45.760
And people expect it to be something else.

349
00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:46.960
I forget what you said, people expect

350
00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:47.360
it to be.

351
00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:48.480
Well, they think it's because of a

352
00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:49.460
behavioral discrepancy.

353
00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:51.060
It's usually a values discrepancy

354
00:09:51.060 --> 00:09:52.260
is the way that it works out.

355
00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:53.640
So the way that families tend to

356
00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:55.440
break apart, and again, no joke, one

357
00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:56.460
in six Americans is

358
00:09:56.460 --> 00:09:58.240
not talking to a family member today

359
00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:01.480
because of politics, which is craziness

360
00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:02.040
for happiness.

361
00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:02.520
It's great.

362
00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:04.120
There's one reason of a schism with

363
00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:06.380
family and that's abuse and political

364
00:10:06.380 --> 00:10:07.360
differences that

365
00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:08.360
there should be.

366
00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:10.300
Yeah, that's the only legitimate reason

367
00:10:10.300 --> 00:10:11.320
to have a schism in your family

368
00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:11.680
is because of

369
00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:13.720
abuse and differences of political

370
00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:15.220
opinion are not abuse.

371
00:10:15.540 --> 00:10:16.960
At least they weren't, they didn't

372
00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:17.560
used to be abused.

373
00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:20.440
But if you're being convinced by leaders

374
00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:22.100
who are trying to bring you into

375
00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:22.520
their culture

376
00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:23.880
war, trying to make you a soldier

377
00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:25.000
in their culture war, they'll say

378
00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:26.540
if somebody disagrees

379
00:10:26.540 --> 00:10:29.680
with your view on Supreme Court decisions

380
00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:30.700
or something that they're somehow

381
00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:33.520
erasing your

382
00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:34.620
value as a human being.

383
00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:37.140
I mean, that's this wild leaps of logic.

384
00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:38.620
And we hear about this on college

385
00:10:38.620 --> 00:10:39.800
campuses where I spend a lot of

386
00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:40.620
my time, obviously,

387
00:10:40.980 --> 00:10:42.560
that we're telling people that if

388
00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:43.900
people disagree with you, that they're

389
00:10:43.900 --> 00:10:44.680
erasing you,

390
00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:48.060
that they disagree with your existence

391
00:10:48.060 --> 00:10:48.660
or something.

392
00:10:48.780 --> 00:10:50.880
It's just this crazy existential language

393
00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:52.660
that we're using that's way out of proportion

394
00:10:52.660 --> 00:10:53.160
to everything.

395
00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:55.820
So the only reason to have these

396
00:10:55.820 --> 00:10:57.840
schisms is actual abuse.

397
00:10:58.300 --> 00:11:00.280
And again, people disagree what abuse

398
00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:01.640
is, but it's not that.

399
00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:02.180
Okay.

400
00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:04.900
Now, what do we find with when

401
00:11:04.900 --> 00:11:07.840
people tend to really have a bad

402
00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:08.780
problem in their family?

403
00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:10.680
People think that, for example, I

404
00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:11.860
deal with a lot of students and

405
00:11:11.860 --> 00:11:13.640
they're building their

406
00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:14.940
and figuring out how they're going

407
00:11:14.940 --> 00:11:15.600
to live their own lives.

408
00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:16.580
And it turns out that they disagree

409
00:11:16.580 --> 00:11:17.440
with their parents on a lot.

410
00:11:17.980 --> 00:11:19.200
They come home from college saying

411
00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:19.960
different things.

412
00:11:19.980 --> 00:11:21.940
For example, they're living in a particular

413
00:11:21.940 --> 00:11:24.380
different way, things that their parents might

414
00:11:24.380 --> 00:11:25.300
really disagree with.

415
00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:26.800
It turns out that how you live

416
00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:28.060
your life doesn't matter.

417
00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:29.920
It almost never matters and almost

418
00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:30.720
never leads to schism.

419
00:11:31.580 --> 00:11:33.660
What you say about somebody else's

420
00:11:33.660 --> 00:11:35.220
values is what really matters.

421
00:11:35.780 --> 00:11:36.660
So if you want to have a

422
00:11:36.660 --> 00:11:37.280
really big...

423
00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:39.800
So to all the people in college

424
00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:41.180
who are watching us, I know you

425
00:11:41.180 --> 00:11:42.880
have a huge audience in their

426
00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:44.760
late teens and 20s who are Impact

427
00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:45.760
Theory fans, which is great.

428
00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:48.760
If you want to live your life,

429
00:11:48.860 --> 00:11:50.020
but have a relationship with your

430
00:11:50.020 --> 00:11:51.580
parents, live your

431
00:11:51.580 --> 00:11:53.760
life, but don't tell your parents

432
00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:54.680
that their values are stupid.

433
00:11:55.380 --> 00:11:57.380
That turns out to be a direct

434
00:11:57.380 --> 00:11:59.100
-on attack.

435
00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:01.100
And that leads to bigger problems.

436
00:12:01.460 --> 00:12:02.640
One thing that's become really popular,

437
00:12:02.780 --> 00:12:05.600
though, is tell your dad or your

438
00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:07.500
uncle who says the

439
00:12:07.500 --> 00:12:09.180
racist thing at Thanksgiving, what

440
00:12:09.180 --> 00:12:09.520
you think.

441
00:12:09.700 --> 00:12:10.800
Should they not do that?

442
00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:12.660
No, it's perfectly fine to do that.

443
00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:13.540
But don't freak out.

444
00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:14.680
Don't freak out.

445
00:12:14.820 --> 00:12:16.300
You say, I see it different.

446
00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:18.920
Hey, Uncle Mark, I see it differently.

447
00:12:20.140 --> 00:12:22.680
And as you do, say to yourself

448
00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:24.420
before you begin, I love Uncle Mark,

449
00:12:24.940 --> 00:12:25.380
and I'm going to

450
00:12:25.380 --> 00:12:27.280
use my values right now as a

451
00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:28.180
gift and not as a weapon.

452
00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:31.220
Anytime you use your values as a

453
00:12:31.220 --> 00:12:33.100
weapon, you've denigrated their moral content.

454
00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:35.140
You've eviscerated the effectiveness

455
00:12:35.140 --> 00:12:35.900
of your approach.

456
00:12:35.900 --> 00:12:38.160
But if you use your values as

457
00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:39.580
a gift, it might not always be

458
00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:41.040
taken in a charitable way.

459
00:12:41.580 --> 00:12:43.320
But you're using them for the right reason.

460
00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:45.120
And you've got the odds-on chance

461
00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:46.380
of actually having a good impact.

462
00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:48.420
Okay, this is really interesting.

463
00:12:48.740 --> 00:12:50.420
I had Sam Harris on the show,

464
00:12:50.540 --> 00:12:52.400
who I have a great deal of

465
00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:52.920
respect for.

466
00:12:53.020 --> 00:12:55.400
He has become very unpopular in certain

467
00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:57.400
circles for the way that he is

468
00:12:57.400 --> 00:12:58.280
approaching the problem

469
00:12:58.280 --> 00:12:59.040
of free speech.

470
00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:01.620
I want to be abundantly clear that

471
00:13:01.620 --> 00:13:03.580
my value system tells me that free

472
00:13:03.580 --> 00:13:04.720
speech is worth

473
00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:05.900
dying for.

474
00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:08.760
And so it isn't the thing that

475
00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:11.180
I would expect anybody to reach for

476
00:13:11.180 --> 00:13:11.900
and say, okay, we're

477
00:13:11.900 --> 00:13:13.160
going to clamp down on that.

478
00:13:13.300 --> 00:13:14.780
Now, Sam sees it differently.

479
00:13:15.100 --> 00:13:16.600
And as I try to tease out,

480
00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:19.540
when a smart person, when I learned

481
00:13:19.540 --> 00:13:20.900
one immutable truth, when two

482
00:13:20.900 --> 00:13:23.680
smart people who are sincere think

483
00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:26.340
each other are stupid, then odds are

484
00:13:26.340 --> 00:13:27.020
that they have different

485
00:13:27.020 --> 00:13:27.800
base assumptions.

486
00:13:28.420 --> 00:13:30.180
And when I look at Sam and

487
00:13:30.180 --> 00:13:31.780
I say, okay, Sam's base assumption

488
00:13:31.780 --> 00:13:33.660
is that if something is an

489
00:13:33.660 --> 00:13:37.020
existential threat, then it's worth

490
00:13:37.020 --> 00:13:41.040
stripping away any right to make sure

491
00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:41.800
that we don't

492
00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:43.400
succumb to said existential threat.

493
00:13:44.120 --> 00:13:46.160
And then I was like, okay, because

494
00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:47.020
I don't know that I would disagree

495
00:13:47.020 --> 00:13:47.420
with that.

496
00:13:47.620 --> 00:13:50.120
If I knew there was an asteroid

497
00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:51.460
hurtling towards Earth and it was

498
00:13:51.460 --> 00:13:52.420
life or death and

499
00:13:52.420 --> 00:13:53.260
we were all going to have to

500
00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:54.280
get on the same page and do

501
00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:57.440
XYZ thing, if I really knew that

502
00:13:57.440 --> 00:14:00.380
it was do X survive, do Y,

503
00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:04.240
everyone dies, then I would for sure

504
00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:05.440
say do X.

505
00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:06.340
It makes sense.

506
00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.140
But I don't think people know how

507
00:14:09.140 --> 00:14:12.740
to agree on what is the right

508
00:14:12.740 --> 00:14:13.480
course of action.

509
00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:13.800
On when-

510
00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:15.100
Nor do you have perfect knowledge.

511
00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:15.460
Right.

512
00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:16.620
So no perfect knowledge.

513
00:14:16.760 --> 00:14:18.600
You don't know if it's actually an

514
00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:19.420
existential threat.

515
00:14:20.060 --> 00:14:21.980
And so I'll take it out of

516
00:14:21.980 --> 00:14:22.720
that realm for a second.

517
00:14:22.820 --> 00:14:23.700
That's the problem, right?

518
00:14:23.700 --> 00:14:24.820
People don't have perfect knowledge.

519
00:14:24.820 --> 00:14:27.920
They don't know, but, and now I'll

520
00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:28.880
take it in the realm that I

521
00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:30.160
do understand very well.

522
00:14:30.780 --> 00:14:32.380
When you're building a business, you

523
00:14:32.380 --> 00:14:34.400
must give your team certainty.

524
00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:34.860
Right.

525
00:14:34.920 --> 00:14:36.240
It's what I call intoxicating them

526
00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:36.640
with certainty.

527
00:14:36.780 --> 00:14:38.140
It's the only way to get them

528
00:14:38.140 --> 00:14:38.720
to follow you.

529
00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:39.060
Right.

530
00:14:39.180 --> 00:14:40.640
Now the catch is as a leader,

531
00:14:40.760 --> 00:14:41.860
you have to balance.

532
00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:43.900
You know that your team has a

533
00:14:43.900 --> 00:14:44.580
need for certainty.

534
00:14:44.700 --> 00:14:45.600
It's the only way to get them

535
00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:46.500
moving in the same direction.

536
00:14:46.620 --> 00:14:46.800
Right.

537
00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:48.200
But you have to balance that with

538
00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:49.300
what we were talking about before,

539
00:14:49.320 --> 00:14:49.820
what I call the

540
00:14:49.820 --> 00:14:50.800
physics of progress.

541
00:14:51.180 --> 00:14:52.820
That the only way to make progress

542
00:14:52.820 --> 00:14:54.440
is to constantly hunger for how am

543
00:14:54.440 --> 00:14:54.900
I wrong?

544
00:14:55.560 --> 00:14:56.640
So you have to, okay, I was

545
00:14:56.640 --> 00:14:57.200
wrong here.

546
00:14:57.280 --> 00:14:58.280
I need to update my thinking.

547
00:14:58.400 --> 00:14:59.440
I need to update my approach.

548
00:14:59.520 --> 00:15:01.200
If you don't do that, you're screwed.

549
00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:03.320
But now there's tension between, I

550
00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:04.940
need to present to my team, hey,

551
00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:05.960
this is the way,

552
00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:07.420
but I also need to beg my

553
00:15:07.420 --> 00:15:08.600
team to tell me at all times

554
00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:09.220
how I'm wrong.

555
00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:09.920
Right.

556
00:15:09.940 --> 00:15:11.080
Because they're the ones that are

557
00:15:11.080 --> 00:15:12.540
going to recognize the flaw in your

558
00:15:12.540 --> 00:15:13.120
thinking that are

559
00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:14.140
going to show you a better way.

560
00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:14.460
Right.

561
00:15:14.580 --> 00:15:16.800
So it's this absolutely fascinating tension.

562
00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:19.180
Now, when this plays out in the

563
00:15:19.180 --> 00:15:21.700
bigger world with the speed of information

564
00:15:21.700 --> 00:15:22.120
that we have

565
00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:23.200
today, thanks to the internet and

566
00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:25.880
social media, you get this, which

567
00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:27.980
I would say has a level

568
00:15:27.980 --> 00:15:31.140
of pathology in it that scares the

569
00:15:31.140 --> 00:15:31.940
life out of me.

570
00:15:32.520 --> 00:15:35.740
So how do we manage that tension

571
00:15:35.740 --> 00:15:38.460
of it's imperfect knowledge, but I

572
00:15:38.460 --> 00:15:39.640
must give certainty

573
00:15:39.640 --> 00:15:42.320
in order to get a country or

574
00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:45.200
a globe moving in the right direction

575
00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:46.240
and an easy way to

576
00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:47.340
give people certainty is to say, we're

577
00:15:47.340 --> 00:15:48.040
all going to die.

578
00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:49.100
Right, right.

579
00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:50.700
Which is the thing that people reach for.

580
00:15:50.860 --> 00:15:51.000
Right.

581
00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:53.080
But if you don't give people certainty,

582
00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:55.160
everybody runs in weird directions.

583
00:15:55.380 --> 00:15:58.980
Well, the Buddhist would say the answer

584
00:15:58.980 --> 00:16:02.020
to that question is intention without attachment.

585
00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:02.500
Okay.

586
00:16:02.580 --> 00:16:04.400
So certainty is this is the direction

587
00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:04.900
that we're going.

588
00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:05.980
This is the goal.

589
00:16:06.180 --> 00:16:08.700
This is the target as far as

590
00:16:08.700 --> 00:16:09.620
I can see it.

591
00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:11.880
But I'm not attached to that because

592
00:16:11.880 --> 00:16:13.700
this is subject to updating.

593
00:16:13.700 --> 00:16:15.300
So you'll find, for example, you look

594
00:16:15.300 --> 00:16:17.080
at the ancient navigational course

595
00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:18.020
of Columbus

596
00:16:18.540 --> 00:16:20.360
or, you know, the explorers, you know,

597
00:16:20.380 --> 00:16:22.480
that had very imperfect tools.

598
00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:24.060
They had a concept of the direction

599
00:16:24.060 --> 00:16:25.020
that they were going and they had

600
00:16:25.020 --> 00:16:25.860
a particular goal

601
00:16:25.860 --> 00:16:27.360
and they were going toward that goal

602
00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:28.240
with complete certainty.

603
00:16:28.460 --> 00:16:29.540
It was, you know, Columbus was an

604
00:16:29.540 --> 00:16:31.420
entrepreneur and he was taking his

605
00:16:31.420 --> 00:16:32.560
team, the Nina Pinton

606
00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:34.880
Santa Maria toward this particular goal.

607
00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:36.480
And it turned out to be completely wrong.

608
00:16:36.860 --> 00:16:38.360
But the point is that the certainty

609
00:16:38.360 --> 00:16:39.460
was the intention.

610
00:16:39.460 --> 00:16:41.740
The fact that they got something else

611
00:16:41.740 --> 00:16:44.440
that was arguably better was the lack

612
00:16:44.440 --> 00:16:45.100
of attachment

613
00:16:45.100 --> 00:16:47.120
to the object of the intention.

614
00:16:47.320 --> 00:16:48.760
And this is what we're trying to

615
00:16:48.760 --> 00:16:51.520
do in our companies, in our families,

616
00:16:51.520 --> 00:16:52.680
and indeed in

617
00:16:52.680 --> 00:16:54.240
the enterprise, the ultimate enterprise

618
00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:56.320
that we need to impact, which is

619
00:16:56.320 --> 00:16:57.040
our lives.

620
00:16:57.660 --> 00:16:59.140
I mean, it's like you're Tom Inc.

621
00:16:59.180 --> 00:17:00.540
That's the real enterprise of you.

622
00:17:00.700 --> 00:17:01.920
I mean, it just manifested itself

623
00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:03.340
and all these other cool businesses

624
00:17:03.340 --> 00:17:03.820
and the things

625
00:17:03.820 --> 00:17:04.400
are really successful.

626
00:17:04.540 --> 00:17:05.940
But all those were just expressions

627
00:17:05.940 --> 00:17:07.780
of the real enterprise.

628
00:17:07.780 --> 00:17:09.880
And each of us is an entrepreneur

629
00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:11.220
in the startup of our lives.

630
00:17:11.420 --> 00:17:12.740
That's what really matters.

631
00:17:12.840 --> 00:17:14.240
And what we need is to always

632
00:17:14.240 --> 00:17:17.160
have a clear intention, but not attachment

633
00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:18.180
to the object

634
00:17:18.180 --> 00:17:19.240
of that intention, because that makes

635
00:17:19.240 --> 00:17:19.940
you dogmatic.

636
00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:21.880
And the problem that we have right

637
00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:24.240
now is we have fuzzy intention and

638
00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:25.120
strong attachment.

639
00:17:25.300 --> 00:17:27.200
We have exactly the opposite of what

640
00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:28.760
we need in our politics today and

641
00:17:28.760 --> 00:17:29.300
the way that people

642
00:17:29.300 --> 00:17:30.980
talk to each other, the way that

643
00:17:30.980 --> 00:17:31.600
people debate.

644
00:17:31.880 --> 00:17:32.760
And so if I have a strong

645
00:17:32.760 --> 00:17:34.500
intention and the things that I believe,

646
00:17:35.020 --> 00:17:36.740
even politically, but

647
00:17:36.740 --> 00:17:38.760
a lack of strong attachment, I can

648
00:17:38.760 --> 00:17:39.660
have a conversation.

649
00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:40.920
And Sam Harris and I had a

650
00:17:40.920 --> 00:17:42.340
similar conversation, except it was

651
00:17:42.340 --> 00:17:43.000
about religion.

652
00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:45.940
And I'm a traditionally religious

653
00:17:45.940 --> 00:17:47.520
person and he's an atheist.

654
00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:49.140
And the way that we went at

655
00:17:49.140 --> 00:17:52.160
it before we hit record on a

656
00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:53.400
show, we said, we're going

657
00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:54.620
to talk about this to learn.

658
00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:56.240
We're not going to talk about this

659
00:17:56.240 --> 00:17:56.560
to argue.

660
00:17:56.620 --> 00:17:57.720
We're going to talk about this to learn.

661
00:17:57.880 --> 00:17:58.020
Right.

662
00:17:58.160 --> 00:17:59.600
And so when he would say something

663
00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:01.200
I thought was like, whoa, I'd be

664
00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:02.540
like, dude, tell me

665
00:18:02.540 --> 00:18:02.880
more.

666
00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:04.980
And he would say, explain this to

667
00:18:04.980 --> 00:18:06.460
me because this sounds crazy to me.

668
00:18:06.460 --> 00:18:07.940
So truly explain this to me.

669
00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:08.780
So what is that?

670
00:18:08.840 --> 00:18:10.540
That was, we both had this intention,

671
00:18:10.760 --> 00:18:12.080
but we didn't have the attachment.

672
00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:13.740
And so we're willing to update.

673
00:18:13.860 --> 00:18:15.200
And so doing, we got better.

674
00:18:15.340 --> 00:18:17.240
Now, when you're running a team, if

675
00:18:17.240 --> 00:18:18.040
you've got a company, and I've been

676
00:18:18.040 --> 00:18:18.920
a CEO, so I've

677
00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:21.900
made all these mistakes over the years.

678
00:18:22.260 --> 00:18:23.980
If they see that you have this

679
00:18:23.980 --> 00:18:26.060
very clear intention, we're running

680
00:18:26.060 --> 00:18:26.720
this direction.

681
00:18:26.920 --> 00:18:27.800
This is what we think.

682
00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:28.980
This is my best judgment.

683
00:18:29.240 --> 00:18:31.300
But my attachment to these things

684
00:18:31.300 --> 00:18:33.740
is not absolute.

685
00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:35.820
You can throw me off this if

686
00:18:35.820 --> 00:18:37.380
you actually bring the best possible

687
00:18:37.380 --> 00:18:38.320
information to me.

688
00:18:38.360 --> 00:18:40.180
And you can tell me that the

689
00:18:40.180 --> 00:18:41.160
way I'm thinking about it is not

690
00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:42.000
quite right, then I'm going

691
00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:42.900
to change the intention.

692
00:18:43.520 --> 00:18:45.020
But in the meantime, this is the

693
00:18:45.020 --> 00:18:46.180
direction that we're all going.

694
00:18:46.520 --> 00:18:47.840
That turns out to be the way

695
00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:48.680
to square the circle.

696
00:18:48.800 --> 00:18:49.760
This turns out to be the way

697
00:18:49.760 --> 00:18:51.600
to solve this problem personally,

698
00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:53.420
in families, in communities,

699
00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:55.960
and in companies, is intention without attachment.

700
00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:57.380
All right.

701
00:18:57.400 --> 00:18:57.820
That's amazing.

702
00:18:57.960 --> 00:18:59.920
But how do you do that?

703
00:18:59.920 --> 00:19:01.920
How do you, I have a feeling

704
00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:03.020
that a big part of the problem

705
00:19:03.020 --> 00:19:06.220
is people have accidentally

706
00:19:07.060 --> 00:19:09.500
constructed their identity around

707
00:19:09.500 --> 00:19:11.380
that which they think they are.

708
00:19:11.920 --> 00:19:13.940
So I am, in fact, oh God,

709
00:19:13.980 --> 00:19:16.000
if I can remember, this is maybe

710
00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:17.040
a paraphrase, but it's really

711
00:19:17.040 --> 00:19:18.160
damn close to something you said.

712
00:19:18.580 --> 00:19:23.740
We need less activists and more volunteers.

713
00:19:24.900 --> 00:19:25.780
And when somebody-

714
00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:27.040
You read my column.

715
00:19:27.620 --> 00:19:29.660
I have tried to immerse myself in

716
00:19:29.660 --> 00:19:29.980
your world.

717
00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:32.300
One, for this, and two, you are

718
00:19:32.300 --> 00:19:34.360
incredibly helpful for navigating

719
00:19:34.360 --> 00:19:35.980
people trying to do

720
00:19:35.980 --> 00:19:37.320
extraordinary things in their life

721
00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:38.240
in a way that makes their life

722
00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:39.200
better and not worse.

723
00:19:39.340 --> 00:19:41.860
So the striver's curse, I forget the

724
00:19:41.860 --> 00:19:42.480
exact words you used.

725
00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:43.180
The striver's curse.

726
00:19:43.300 --> 00:19:43.800
But perfect.

727
00:19:44.080 --> 00:19:45.040
Yeah, you're good.

728
00:19:45.320 --> 00:19:48.320
So if people identify as an activist

729
00:19:48.320 --> 00:19:50.800
or a volunteer, that simple, like

730
00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:51.540
even you just

731
00:19:51.540 --> 00:19:52.820
giving me the language, I was like,

732
00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:54.820
oh, whoa, I get what you're trying

733
00:19:54.820 --> 00:19:55.200
to say.

734
00:19:55.200 --> 00:19:58.780
Helping others versus like my identity

735
00:19:58.780 --> 00:20:00.480
is this thing and I'm going to

736
00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:01.160
fight to the death

737
00:20:01.160 --> 00:20:01.880
for this.

738
00:20:03.040 --> 00:20:05.480
But how do you begin to extricate

739
00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:07.620
your identity from the things that

740
00:20:07.620 --> 00:20:09.260
you believe so that you

741
00:20:09.260 --> 00:20:10.400
can have non-attachment?

742
00:20:10.900 --> 00:20:11.980
To begin with, we have to ask,

743
00:20:12.120 --> 00:20:13.040
who am I?

744
00:20:13.900 --> 00:20:15.160
And you're going to define that or

745
00:20:15.160 --> 00:20:16.180
you're going to discover that?

746
00:20:16.260 --> 00:20:18.160
Well, you ultimately discover that,

747
00:20:18.220 --> 00:20:19.480
but you have to have an understanding

748
00:20:19.480 --> 00:20:20.300
of that that's

749
00:20:20.300 --> 00:20:22.760
not brittle and that's not based on

750
00:20:22.760 --> 00:20:23.600
the outside world.

751
00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:25.400
There's a philosophical concept that

752
00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:26.820
William James talked about, but the

753
00:20:26.820 --> 00:20:27.560
Eastern philosophers

754
00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:29.300
talk about this a lot too, which

755
00:20:29.300 --> 00:20:30.920
is what William James called the I

756
00:20:30.920 --> 00:20:32.360
-Self versus the Me-Self.

757
00:20:32.740 --> 00:20:34.640
The I-Self is, say you're looking

758
00:20:34.640 --> 00:20:36.020
in a mirror and when you look

759
00:20:36.020 --> 00:20:36.720
in the mirror, there's actually,

760
00:20:36.840 --> 00:20:37.880
there's two of you.

761
00:20:38.360 --> 00:20:39.300
There's the one who's looking and

762
00:20:39.300 --> 00:20:40.360
the one who's being looked at.

763
00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:42.000
The one who's looking is the I

764
00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:43.500
-Self, the observer of the world.

765
00:20:43.580 --> 00:20:44.600
The one who's being looked at is

766
00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:46.180
the Me-Self, which is the observed.

767
00:20:46.600 --> 00:20:48.940
You're going through life as I-Self

768
00:20:48.940 --> 00:20:49.440
and Me-Self.

769
00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:50.500
You need Me-Self to know who

770
00:20:50.500 --> 00:20:51.860
you are and where you stand in

771
00:20:51.860 --> 00:20:54.380
society and where you are

772
00:20:54.380 --> 00:20:55.460
on the team and where you are

773
00:20:55.460 --> 00:20:57.060
in the hierarchy and where you are

774
00:20:57.060 --> 00:20:58.600
in traffic for that matter.

775
00:20:58.860 --> 00:21:00.220
But you need the I-Self so

776
00:21:00.220 --> 00:21:01.700
that you can learn and you can exist.

777
00:21:01.960 --> 00:21:03.800
We are all too heavy on the

778
00:21:03.800 --> 00:21:05.600
Me-Self, on the observed, and none

779
00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:07.000
of us, almost none of us

780
00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:08.980
is heavy enough on the observer part.

781
00:21:09.440 --> 00:21:10.780
So one of the exercises I'll give

782
00:21:10.780 --> 00:21:12.720
my students at Harvard Business School,

783
00:21:12.800 --> 00:21:13.140
they take this

784
00:21:13.140 --> 00:21:14.540
happiness class, which is about the,

785
00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:16.240
it's called leadership and happiness,

786
00:21:16.420 --> 00:21:17.520
the serious science

787
00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:19.360
of the business of you.

788
00:21:19.780 --> 00:21:21.560
And I'll say, we're going to go

789
00:21:21.560 --> 00:21:22.340
through an hour.

790
00:21:22.560 --> 00:21:23.860
You're going to take an hour where

791
00:21:23.860 --> 00:21:25.140
you're not going to be observed.

792
00:21:25.280 --> 00:21:26.800
You're simply going to observe.

793
00:21:27.360 --> 00:21:28.440
And now this means a lot.

794
00:21:28.680 --> 00:21:30.180
This means, for example, you say like,

795
00:21:30.640 --> 00:21:32.540
you don't say, yeah, this coffee is bitter.

796
00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:34.820
You say, hmm, this coffee has a

797
00:21:34.820 --> 00:21:35.320
bitter flavor.

798
00:21:35.540 --> 00:21:36.420
Nothing more than observation.

799
00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:37.880
There's no mirrors.

800
00:21:38.160 --> 00:21:40.140
There's no notifications on social media.

801
00:21:40.360 --> 00:21:41.140
There's no judgments.

802
00:21:41.340 --> 00:21:43.860
There's just observation of the world

803
00:21:43.860 --> 00:21:45.260
to get better at that.

804
00:21:45.260 --> 00:21:48.020
And this is incredibly important if

805
00:21:48.020 --> 00:21:49.260
we want to learn and we want

806
00:21:49.260 --> 00:21:49.840
to update.

807
00:21:50.380 --> 00:21:51.880
This also gets us away from this

808
00:21:51.880 --> 00:21:54.580
whole concept of my identity in my ideology.

809
00:21:55.100 --> 00:21:56.800
Because what that fundamentally is,

810
00:21:56.800 --> 00:21:58.520
is just me, me, me, me, me,

811
00:21:58.580 --> 00:21:59.520
me, me, me, me.

812
00:21:59.580 --> 00:22:00.640
It's like, who am I?

813
00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:01.900
I am the things that I think.

814
00:22:01.960 --> 00:22:04.120
If somebody disagrees with me, then

815
00:22:04.120 --> 00:22:05.180
they're attacking me.

816
00:22:05.260 --> 00:22:06.140
That's insanity.

817
00:22:06.560 --> 00:22:08.420
That's pure vanity.

818
00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:10.840
That is just looking in a mirror

819
00:22:10.840 --> 00:22:13.220
all day long saying, mirror, mirror

820
00:22:13.220 --> 00:22:14.080
on the wall, who's

821
00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:15.480
the most beautiful of them all?

822
00:22:15.660 --> 00:22:17.480
It's me and my political beliefs.

823
00:22:18.100 --> 00:22:19.260
That's craziness.

824
00:22:19.400 --> 00:22:20.500
There's no way to live.

825
00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:22.000
And by the way, that's the fastest

826
00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:23.820
way to become a truly unhappy person.

827
00:22:25.100 --> 00:22:27.160
The reason is because you need the

828
00:22:27.160 --> 00:22:29.340
grandeur of the world to actually

829
00:22:29.340 --> 00:22:30.140
give you what you

830
00:22:30.140 --> 00:22:32.280
need, the experience of day-to-day life.

831
00:22:32.480 --> 00:22:35.380
And living in the image of yourself

832
00:22:35.380 --> 00:22:37.240
is just boring.

833
00:22:37.980 --> 00:22:39.180
It's just tedious.

834
00:22:40.140 --> 00:22:41.780
Thinking about me and what they think

835
00:22:41.780 --> 00:22:42.860
of me and whether or not they

836
00:22:42.860 --> 00:22:43.700
agree with me and

837
00:22:43.700 --> 00:22:44.640
whether or not these things are going

838
00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:46.460
to satisfy me, me, me, me, me.

839
00:22:46.480 --> 00:22:48.160
It's like watching the same episode

840
00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:50.320
of the same season of Better Call

841
00:22:50.320 --> 00:22:51.900
Saul every single

842
00:22:51.900 --> 00:22:53.380
day for the rest of your life.

843
00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:55.240
It was okay the first time.

844
00:22:55.860 --> 00:22:57.360
It was not that great the second time.

845
00:22:57.600 --> 00:22:59.220
And it's awful every time after that.

846
00:22:59.380 --> 00:23:00.800
And being forced to do that, that's

847
00:23:00.800 --> 00:23:01.580
identity politics.

848
00:23:02.100 --> 00:23:03.180
That's the world of identity.

849
00:23:03.300 --> 00:23:04.240
That's the world of mirrors.

850
00:23:04.440 --> 00:23:06.880
That's the world of social media notifications.

851
00:23:07.040 --> 00:23:09.060
That's the world of the me-self

852
00:23:09.060 --> 00:23:10.100
is what it comes down to.

853
00:23:10.100 --> 00:23:11.480
So, if we really want to be

854
00:23:11.480 --> 00:23:13.520
happy, get into the I-self, the

855
00:23:13.520 --> 00:23:15.260
learning space, the observation,

856
00:23:15.680 --> 00:23:17.720
the awe of the outside world and

857
00:23:17.720 --> 00:23:19.020
your life will change.

858
00:23:19.260 --> 00:23:21.180
It'll just change.

859
00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:22.140
And it's fast.

860
00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:25.660
You can reboot your life, your health,

861
00:23:25.760 --> 00:23:27.580
even your career, anything you want.

862
00:23:27.800 --> 00:23:29.360
All you need is discipline.

863
00:23:29.660 --> 00:23:31.000
I can teach you the tactics that

864
00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:32.360
I learned while growing a billion

865
00:23:32.360 --> 00:23:33.160
-dollar business that

866
00:23:33.160 --> 00:23:35.440
will allow you to see your goals through.

867
00:23:35.620 --> 00:23:36.820
Whether you want better health, stronger

868
00:23:36.820 --> 00:23:39.000
relationships, a more successful career,

869
00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:40.740
any of that is possible with the

870
00:23:40.740 --> 00:23:42.920
mindset and business programs in Impact

00:23:52.920 --> 00:23:55.880
So, in the book, you say that

877
00:23:55.880 --> 00:23:58.100
basically exactly what you just said,

878
00:23:58.220 --> 00:24:00.220
that happiness isn't the

879
00:24:00.220 --> 00:24:02.340
feeling, but the feeling is evidence

880
00:24:02.340 --> 00:24:03.780
of the happiness.

881
00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:04.140
Right.

882
00:24:04.260 --> 00:24:05.720
So then what is the happiness?

883
00:24:05.880 --> 00:24:08.120
What is the meat and potatoes?

884
00:24:08.120 --> 00:24:10.280
Yeah, that's a good analogy because

885
00:24:10.280 --> 00:24:12.020
it's either the courses or really

886
00:24:12.020 --> 00:24:12.880
the macronutrients

887
00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:15.040
and the thing that is happiness has

888
00:24:15.040 --> 00:24:16.060
three parts to it.

889
00:24:16.080 --> 00:24:18.540
And we know this from measuring people

890
00:24:18.540 --> 00:24:19.640
who have high levels of well-being

891
00:24:19.640 --> 00:24:20.220
versus those

892
00:24:20.220 --> 00:24:20.620
who don't.

893
00:24:21.460 --> 00:24:23.240
High well-being is associated with

894
00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:25.080
high levels of enjoyment, satisfaction

895
00:24:25.080 --> 00:24:26.940
and meaning in

896
00:24:26.940 --> 00:24:27.120
life.

897
00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:28.600
Those are the three things that we

898
00:24:28.600 --> 00:24:29.380
need to actually pursue.

899
00:24:29.460 --> 00:24:30.900
The pursuit of happiness is the pursuit

900
00:24:30.900 --> 00:24:33.160
of enjoyment, the pursuit of satisfaction and

901
00:24:33.160 --> 00:24:34.040
the pursuit of meaning.

902
00:24:34.040 --> 00:24:36.080
And there are three different goals

903
00:24:36.080 --> 00:24:37.920
with three different sciences and

904
00:24:37.920 --> 00:24:39.060
three different strategies

905
00:24:39.060 --> 00:24:39.520
to it.

906
00:24:39.640 --> 00:24:41.800
When somebody only pursues one, they're

907
00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:42.580
not going to be happy.

908
00:24:42.680 --> 00:24:45.180
You need a balance and abundance across

909
00:24:45.180 --> 00:24:47.120
this macronutrient profile for happiness

910
00:24:47.120 --> 00:24:47.480
if you're

911
00:24:47.480 --> 00:24:47.920
going to get it.

912
00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:49.460
I meet people all the time who

913
00:24:49.460 --> 00:24:50.580
have great enjoyment in life, but

914
00:24:50.580 --> 00:24:51.220
very little meaning

915
00:24:51.220 --> 00:24:51.840
and they're not happy.

916
00:24:52.560 --> 00:24:54.200
I know people, hardworking entrepreneurs

917
00:24:54.200 --> 00:24:56.400
who have tremendous meaning and no

918
00:24:56.400 --> 00:24:56.920
quality of

919
00:24:56.920 --> 00:24:57.680
life, no enjoyment.

920
00:24:57.860 --> 00:24:58.420
They're not happy.

921
00:24:58.600 --> 00:25:00.080
And so I have to coach people

922
00:25:00.080 --> 00:25:01.100
in different ways about this.

923
00:25:01.100 --> 00:25:02.700
Satisfaction is the hardest of them.

924
00:25:02.840 --> 00:25:03.620
I was going to ask.

925
00:25:03.720 --> 00:25:05.360
Because you can't keep it, you know?

926
00:25:05.440 --> 00:25:06.720
And so they each have a science.

927
00:25:06.740 --> 00:25:07.740
Why can't you keep satisfaction?

928
00:25:07.880 --> 00:25:10.160
Because the brain is something has

929
00:25:10.160 --> 00:25:11.780
a tendency to be homeostatic.

930
00:25:12.760 --> 00:25:14.180
Homeostasis is the tendency of the

931
00:25:14.180 --> 00:25:15.700
brain to always take you emotionally

932
00:25:15.700 --> 00:25:16.640
back to equilibrium.

933
00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:17.980
So you'll be ready for the next

934
00:25:17.980 --> 00:25:18.700
set of circumstances.

935
00:25:19.180 --> 00:25:19.440
Interesting.

936
00:25:19.540 --> 00:25:20.380
Can I push back on that?

937
00:25:20.400 --> 00:25:20.620
Yeah.

938
00:25:20.800 --> 00:25:23.280
So one, obviously I agree with homeostasis,

939
00:25:23.640 --> 00:25:26.060
but the way that I've always thought about

940
00:25:26.060 --> 00:25:28.740
how transient satisfaction is going

941
00:25:28.740 --> 00:25:29.900
back to understanding the science

942
00:25:29.900 --> 00:25:30.840
is from an evolutionary

943
00:25:30.840 --> 00:25:31.420
standpoint.

944
00:25:32.420 --> 00:25:34.060
If you ate a meal and it

945
00:25:34.060 --> 00:25:36.500
was satisfying forever, you would

946
00:25:36.500 --> 00:25:37.060
starve to death.

947
00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:37.300
Right.

948
00:25:37.380 --> 00:25:38.280
Because you would only eat once.

949
00:25:38.380 --> 00:25:38.500
Right.

950
00:25:38.600 --> 00:25:41.800
And so knowing that evolution will

951
00:25:41.800 --> 00:25:42.940
conserve, conserve, conserve.

952
00:25:43.260 --> 00:25:45.620
If I have this mechanism that makes

953
00:25:45.620 --> 00:25:47.020
sure that I go do the thing

954
00:25:47.020 --> 00:25:48.760
again, that is basically

955
00:25:48.760 --> 00:25:52.000
this rise and fall of satisfaction

956
00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:54.380
that happens with everything that

957
00:25:54.380 --> 00:25:55.540
I would be in trouble

958
00:25:55.540 --> 00:25:56.620
if I only did once.

959
00:25:56.720 --> 00:25:56.860
Right.

960
00:25:57.140 --> 00:26:00.320
So thirst, satisfaction going to rise

961
00:26:00.320 --> 00:26:00.720
and fall.

962
00:26:00.720 --> 00:26:01.840
Hunger, rise and fall.

963
00:26:02.040 --> 00:26:03.460
Sex, rise and fall.

964
00:26:03.720 --> 00:26:03.740
Right.

965
00:26:04.740 --> 00:26:05.140
Consumption.

966
00:26:06.160 --> 00:26:08.860
Consumption, pursuit, hierarchy, prestige,

967
00:26:09.900 --> 00:26:12.540
the watch, the car, the house, all

968
00:26:12.540 --> 00:26:12.700
of it.

969
00:26:12.820 --> 00:26:13.500
Well, now it's interesting.

970
00:26:13.680 --> 00:26:16.960
Now I wonder if that is homeostasis.

971
00:26:17.100 --> 00:26:17.740
That is homeostasis.

972
00:26:17.840 --> 00:26:20.940
Because the watch losing its thing,

973
00:26:21.020 --> 00:26:22.200
although it's probably the same mechanism,

974
00:26:22.440 --> 00:26:23.600
because it's trying to get me to

975
00:26:23.600 --> 00:26:24.620
go do more, go do more.

976
00:26:24.680 --> 00:26:24.700
Right.

977
00:26:24.780 --> 00:26:25.940
And here's the thing about it.

978
00:26:25.980 --> 00:26:28.440
The reason that we don't ever realize

979
00:26:28.440 --> 00:26:30.040
that when you think, when people say,

980
00:26:30.040 --> 00:26:32.000
I move to California because then

981
00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:32.940
I'll be permanently happy because

982
00:26:32.940 --> 00:26:33.640
of the sunshine.

983
00:26:34.540 --> 00:26:36.820
No, the big benefit that you get

984
00:26:36.820 --> 00:26:38.460
from, mood benefit from sunshine is

985
00:26:38.460 --> 00:26:39.040
six months,

986
00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:40.520
but the taxes are forever.

987
00:26:40.820 --> 00:26:40.960
Yeah.

988
00:26:41.300 --> 00:26:42.660
So I have to tell you.

989
00:26:42.720 --> 00:26:43.100
Tell me about it.

990
00:26:43.600 --> 00:26:45.140
So I'm not trying to hurt you, man.

991
00:26:45.280 --> 00:26:47.760
So the key thing to understand about

992
00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:49.400
homeostasis is that Mother Nature

993
00:26:49.400 --> 00:26:51.060
doesn't want you to know

994
00:26:51.060 --> 00:26:51.900
it exists.

995
00:26:52.500 --> 00:26:54.340
Mother Nature has homeostasis so that

996
00:26:54.340 --> 00:26:55.260
you'd be ready for the next set

997
00:26:55.260 --> 00:26:55.820
of circumstances,

998
00:26:55.820 --> 00:26:57.560
but fools you again and again and

999
00:26:57.560 --> 00:26:59.180
again into thinking that this time

1000
00:26:59.180 --> 00:26:59.760
the satisfaction

1001
00:26:59.760 --> 00:27:00.340
will be permanent.

1002
00:27:00.640 --> 00:27:01.500
And it never is.

1003
00:27:01.720 --> 00:27:03.040
By the way, this is physical too.

1004
00:27:03.600 --> 00:27:05.240
So you step off the treadmill and

1005
00:27:05.240 --> 00:27:08.140
your heart is going 135 beats per minute,

1006
00:27:08.220 --> 00:27:09.940
which you're doing for good cardiovascular health.

1007
00:27:10.020 --> 00:27:11.480
Within 15 minutes, your heart rate

1008
00:27:11.480 --> 00:27:13.160
has gone back to its base rate.

1009
00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:13.880
So you don't die.

1010
00:27:14.540 --> 00:27:15.420
Well, the same thing is true with

1011
00:27:15.420 --> 00:27:15.920
your emotions.

1012
00:27:16.180 --> 00:27:18.020
Homeostasis has to reset you.

1013
00:27:18.540 --> 00:27:20.360
But when it comes to the satisfactions

1014
00:27:20.360 --> 00:27:22.700
that we seek, you know, caloric or,

1015
00:27:22.860 --> 00:27:23.060
you know,

1016
00:27:23.220 --> 00:27:24.680
propagation of the genes through mating

1017
00:27:24.680 --> 00:27:25.720
and all the stuff that we want

1018
00:27:25.720 --> 00:27:26.000
to do.

1019
00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:28.100
We always think that that relationship

1020
00:27:28.100 --> 00:27:29.580
will give me permanent satisfaction.

1021
00:27:29.580 --> 00:27:31.440
Because if you knew, if you knew,

1022
00:27:31.780 --> 00:27:32.240
then you'd be like,

1023
00:27:32.380 --> 00:27:33.580
that's going to give me 10 minutes

1024
00:27:33.580 --> 00:27:33.980
of happiness.

1025
00:27:34.100 --> 00:27:35.080
I'm not even going to do it.

1026
00:27:35.140 --> 00:27:38.480
And you'd stop being, you wouldn't

1027
00:27:38.480 --> 00:27:39.040
be in the hustle.

1028
00:27:39.300 --> 00:27:40.380
You wouldn't be in the fight anymore.

1029
00:27:40.600 --> 00:27:41.900
You wouldn't go get the banana off

1030
00:27:41.900 --> 00:27:42.900
the top of the tree and risk

1031
00:27:42.900 --> 00:27:43.380
your life.

1032
00:27:43.620 --> 00:27:45.340
You wouldn't trudge across the savannah

1033
00:27:45.340 --> 00:27:46.120
to get that meal.

1034
00:27:46.460 --> 00:27:47.940
You would lose your motivation.

1035
00:27:48.280 --> 00:27:50.060
And Mother Nature wants you to be motivated.

1036
00:27:50.180 --> 00:27:51.760
And she does that by fooling you.

1037
00:27:52.340 --> 00:27:53.820
So that you think that this time

1038
00:27:53.820 --> 00:27:55.360
I'm really going to love that car forever.

1039
00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:58.740
And it's like a month, it turns out.

1040
00:27:58.900 --> 00:28:01.000
So that's, so satisfaction is a real conundrum.

1041
00:28:01.860 --> 00:28:03.500
Only when you understand the science,

1042
00:28:03.680 --> 00:28:05.200
can you short circuit the science.

1043
00:28:05.680 --> 00:28:07.800
Only when you, when you understand

1044
00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:09.240
the matrix, can you find a glitch?

1045
00:28:09.400 --> 00:28:10.680
Can you find the glitch in the matrix?

1046
00:28:10.900 --> 00:28:12.720
That's why it's so incredibly empowering.

1047
00:28:12.720 --> 00:28:14.080
Because there is a way around that

1048
00:28:14.080 --> 00:28:14.620
for satisfaction.

1049
00:28:15.380 --> 00:28:16.780
The same thing is true for enjoyment,

1050
00:28:16.900 --> 00:28:17.180
by the way.

1051
00:28:17.220 --> 00:28:18.400
Everybody thinks they enjoy it.

1052
00:28:18.420 --> 00:28:19.020
It's just, you know, pleasure.

1053
00:28:19.260 --> 00:28:19.660
Wrong.

1054
00:28:20.420 --> 00:28:22.200
Pleasure is not the secret of happiness.

1055
00:28:22.380 --> 00:28:25.280
Pleasure is the short way to get addiction.

1056
00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:27.980
And nobody ever says, man, you know

1057
00:28:27.980 --> 00:28:28.860
the secret to my happiness?

1058
00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:30.520
Methamphetamine.

1059
00:28:30.840 --> 00:28:31.120
Never.

1060
00:28:31.760 --> 00:28:33.900
Nobody ever says, oh yeah, it's like

1061
00:28:33.900 --> 00:28:36.220
partying away my entire paycheck in Vegas.

1062
00:28:36.800 --> 00:28:38.320
And then my wife leaving me.

1063
00:28:38.440 --> 00:28:39.980
That's, that's not the secret of happiness.

1064
00:28:40.440 --> 00:28:41.920
That's the secret to pleasure.

1065
00:28:42.060 --> 00:28:43.700
And pleasure is not connected to happiness

1066
00:28:43.700 --> 00:28:45.500
unless you take pleasure and you add

1067
00:28:45.500 --> 00:28:46.160
two things.

1068
00:28:46.760 --> 00:28:47.960
People and memory.

1069
00:28:48.980 --> 00:28:51.180
If you add pleasure plus people plus

1070
00:28:51.180 --> 00:28:52.380
memory, you get enjoyment.

1071
00:28:52.780 --> 00:28:54.500
Those must be stand-ins for something.

1072
00:28:54.500 --> 00:28:56.460
What are the people and the memory

1073
00:28:56.460 --> 00:28:57.260
stand-ins for?

1074
00:28:57.380 --> 00:28:58.480
Communion and consciousness.

1075
00:28:58.760 --> 00:29:01.760
So just, I'm a social species and

1076
00:29:01.760 --> 00:29:03.300
I'm going to get tremendously rewarded.

1077
00:29:03.580 --> 00:29:05.400
This is a good time to bring up.

1078
00:29:05.580 --> 00:29:07.980
So I'm really obsessed with this idea

1079
00:29:07.980 --> 00:29:10.100
that running in the back of your mind

1080
00:29:10.100 --> 00:29:12.960
are evolutionary algorithms and there's

1081
00:29:12.960 --> 00:29:13.840
no escaping them.

1082
00:29:14.040 --> 00:29:15.660
And so there are just certain things

1083
00:29:15.660 --> 00:29:17.880
you are going to have to do

1084
00:29:17.880 --> 00:29:19.680
if you want to,

1085
00:29:20.660 --> 00:29:21.500
I don't know if you're going to

1086
00:29:21.500 --> 00:29:22.600
agree with this framing,

1087
00:29:22.600 --> 00:29:24.520
but if you, if you're going to

1088
00:29:24.520 --> 00:29:26.080
feel the way you want to feel,

1089
00:29:26.260 --> 00:29:28.440
you must be aware of these algorithms.

1090
00:29:28.660 --> 00:29:29.800
You must acknowledge them.

1091
00:29:30.140 --> 00:29:30.220
Right.

1092
00:29:30.300 --> 00:29:32.760
So I've always tried to migrate people

1093
00:29:32.760 --> 00:29:34.300
away from happiness.

1094
00:29:36.120 --> 00:29:38.420
Not as you define it, as the

1095
00:29:38.420 --> 00:29:39.460
smell of the turkey.

1096
00:29:39.660 --> 00:29:39.680
Right.

1097
00:29:39.820 --> 00:29:41.040
Stop worrying about the emotion.

1098
00:29:41.040 --> 00:29:41.700
Stop worrying about happy feelings.

1099
00:29:41.860 --> 00:29:42.400
Right, exactly.

1100
00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:44.160
Because they're so transient.

1101
00:29:44.380 --> 00:29:44.660
Correct.

1102
00:29:44.780 --> 00:29:45.960
And get to fulfillment.

1103
00:29:46.260 --> 00:29:46.500
Correct.

1104
00:29:46.680 --> 00:29:50.020
And fulfillment for me has a formula.

1105
00:29:50.360 --> 00:29:51.580
I'll be interested to see if you

1106
00:29:51.580 --> 00:29:52.080
agree with this.

1107
00:29:52.780 --> 00:29:54.560
These are based on what I consider

1108
00:29:54.560 --> 00:29:56.160
the evolutionary algorithms running

1109
00:29:56.160 --> 00:29:56.540
in your mind

1110
00:29:56.540 --> 00:29:57.520
that there is no escape from.

1111
00:29:57.660 --> 00:29:59.680
So you are going to have to

1112
00:29:59.680 --> 00:30:00.120
work hard.

1113
00:30:00.360 --> 00:30:02.140
Anything that comes easily will just

1114
00:30:02.140 --> 00:30:03.580
not, it won't resonate.

1115
00:30:03.820 --> 00:30:05.200
That's the satisfaction issue, by

1116
00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:05.380
the way.

1117
00:30:05.480 --> 00:30:07.120
Satisfaction is the joy that comes

1118
00:30:07.120 --> 00:30:07.920
after struggle.

1119
00:30:08.380 --> 00:30:09.740
That's what satisfaction is.

1120
00:30:10.540 --> 00:30:11.300
So you get satisfaction.

1121
00:30:11.620 --> 00:30:12.560
Does it always have to come from struggle?

1122
00:30:12.560 --> 00:30:14.900
You have to do something and it's

1123
00:30:14.900 --> 00:30:16.240
the sense of earning something.

1124
00:30:17.380 --> 00:30:19.480
So for example, if you cheat on

1125
00:30:19.480 --> 00:30:20.620
the exam and you get an A,

1126
00:30:20.700 --> 00:30:21.440
there's no satisfaction.

1127
00:30:21.760 --> 00:30:21.820
True.

1128
00:30:21.820 --> 00:30:24.820
But I feel deeply satisfied after

1129
00:30:24.820 --> 00:30:25.460
good sex.

1130
00:30:26.100 --> 00:30:27.500
Do I feel like I earned it?

1131
00:30:27.560 --> 00:30:27.900
I don't know.

1132
00:30:27.980 --> 00:30:29.560
I have not investigated this feeling.

1133
00:30:29.840 --> 00:30:31.560
Yeah, but that's actually, that's

1134
00:30:31.560 --> 00:30:32.860
not satisfaction.

1135
00:30:33.120 --> 00:30:33.980
That's enjoyment.

1136
00:30:34.140 --> 00:30:34.860
Is it?

1137
00:30:34.940 --> 00:30:35.920
That's what you, and satisfaction.

1138
00:30:36.200 --> 00:30:37.380
You don't feel sexually satisfied?

1139
00:30:37.380 --> 00:30:38.800
Well, that's a word that we use,

1140
00:30:38.840 --> 00:30:40.020
but it's different than what we're

1141
00:30:40.020 --> 00:30:40.800
talking about here.

1142
00:30:41.140 --> 00:30:43.700
So again, we're defining the terms

1143
00:30:43.700 --> 00:30:43.900
of the problem.

1144
00:30:43.900 --> 00:30:44.700
Which I think is important.

1145
00:30:44.820 --> 00:30:45.460
Super important.

1146
00:30:45.600 --> 00:30:47.260
Because you may be about to have

1147
00:30:47.260 --> 00:30:49.220
me separate two ideas that,

1148
00:30:49.340 --> 00:30:50.380
because I don't have words for, I

1149
00:30:50.380 --> 00:30:50.700
don't see the difference.

1150
00:30:50.700 --> 00:30:52.060
Sexual satisfaction, where they're

1151
00:30:52.060 --> 00:30:53.220
talking about a sexual enjoyment.

1152
00:30:53.640 --> 00:30:55.160
So an enjoyment is a better word

1153
00:30:55.160 --> 00:30:55.660
for it.

1154
00:30:55.860 --> 00:30:59.580
So when I am overcome with desire,

1155
00:31:00.020 --> 00:31:01.240
the right way to think of it

1156
00:31:01.240 --> 00:31:02.380
for me is hunger.

1157
00:31:02.500 --> 00:31:03.580
It feels the same.

1158
00:31:03.920 --> 00:31:05.060
I've got to have this thing.

1159
00:31:05.180 --> 00:31:05.880
I really want it.

1160
00:31:06.080 --> 00:31:06.940
Anticipatory chemicals.

1161
00:31:07.160 --> 00:31:07.640
Oh my God.

1162
00:31:08.020 --> 00:31:09.560
And then I get it.

1163
00:31:09.720 --> 00:31:12.060
And so like, I'll differentiate between

1164
00:31:12.060 --> 00:31:13.400
masturbation and sex.

1165
00:31:13.620 --> 00:31:14.880
When I masturbate, I don't necessarily

1166
00:31:14.880 --> 00:31:15.740
feel satisfied.

1167
00:31:15.900 --> 00:31:17.060
That's one of the things that makes

1168
00:31:17.060 --> 00:31:19.300
that such a whatever pursuit.

1169
00:31:19.300 --> 00:31:22.480
Whereas when I have sex, I feel satisfied.

1170
00:31:22.760 --> 00:31:25.200
Like there's some deeper thing in

1171
00:31:25.200 --> 00:31:29.760
me and it is an extinguishing of

1172
00:31:29.760 --> 00:31:30.180
the hunger.

1173
00:31:30.380 --> 00:31:32.760
But because I have oxytocin and vasopressin,

1174
00:31:32.900 --> 00:31:35.400
it's like, oh man, I feel so good.

1175
00:31:35.780 --> 00:31:38.340
So it's this combination of the calming

1176
00:31:38.340 --> 00:31:41.820
of that like seeking behavior with like,

1177
00:31:41.900 --> 00:31:43.880
and I feel so bonded and connected

1178
00:31:43.880 --> 00:31:45.200
to this person.

1179
00:31:45.960 --> 00:31:46.080
Yeah.

1180
00:31:46.100 --> 00:31:46.780
This is just terms.

1181
00:31:46.780 --> 00:31:48.660
So the way to think about it

1182
00:31:48.660 --> 00:31:51.020
in this particular framework is pleasure

1183
00:31:51.020 --> 00:31:51.680
versus enjoyment.

1184
00:31:52.180 --> 00:31:52.360
Got it.

1185
00:31:52.520 --> 00:31:52.660
Okay.

1186
00:31:52.760 --> 00:31:55.400
So pleasure is something that pornography

1187
00:31:55.400 --> 00:31:57.020
is associated with pleasure.

1188
00:31:57.980 --> 00:32:01.180
Sexual activity in a pair bonded relationship

1189
00:32:01.180 --> 00:32:03.540
is associated with enjoyment because

1190
00:32:03.540 --> 00:32:03.800
it has

1191
00:32:03.800 --> 00:32:04.580
people in memory.

1192
00:32:05.320 --> 00:32:06.160
And so one of the things to

1193
00:32:06.160 --> 00:32:07.660
keep in mind, a strategy, especially

1194
00:32:07.660 --> 00:32:08.760
for a lot of young people,

1195
00:32:08.840 --> 00:32:12.280
a lot of young men, is if

1196
00:32:12.280 --> 00:32:15.180
you like something, it's best if you're

1197
00:32:15.180 --> 00:32:16.160
not doing it alone.

1198
00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:18.480
Because then you're probably-

1199
00:32:18.480 --> 00:32:18.820
Full stop?

1200
00:32:19.480 --> 00:32:20.280
Not necessarily.

1201
00:32:20.400 --> 00:32:21.360
This is just kind of a rule

1202
00:32:21.360 --> 00:32:21.780
of thumb.

1203
00:32:22.060 --> 00:32:23.880
This is not an iron law, but

1204
00:32:23.880 --> 00:32:24.680
it's a rule of thumb.

1205
00:32:25.180 --> 00:32:27.300
Doing it alone is associated with pleasure.

1206
00:32:27.560 --> 00:32:30.600
So Anheuser-Busch doesn't do ads about

1207
00:32:30.600 --> 00:32:32.800
beer where they show a dude pounding

1208
00:32:32.800 --> 00:32:33.360
a 12-pack

1209
00:32:33.360 --> 00:32:34.520
alone in his apartment.

1210
00:32:35.240 --> 00:32:35.800
Why not?

1211
00:32:36.020 --> 00:32:36.820
Because that would be-

1212
00:32:36.820 --> 00:32:37.240
Accurate ad.

1213
00:32:37.240 --> 00:32:39.040
That would be, yeah, because a lot

1214
00:32:39.040 --> 00:32:40.560
of people use alcohol for pleasure.

1215
00:32:40.680 --> 00:32:40.900
Right.

1216
00:32:41.020 --> 00:32:42.320
Which leads to addiction and misery.

1217
00:32:42.320 --> 00:32:45.600
They see you and me cracking open

1218
00:32:45.600 --> 00:32:47.740
a Bud Light and clink and talking

1219
00:32:47.740 --> 00:32:48.860
about how great it is

1220
00:32:48.860 --> 00:32:50.100
and because we're friends and we're

1221
00:32:50.100 --> 00:32:50.860
making a memory.

1222
00:32:51.540 --> 00:32:53.500
And that's enjoyment, which is associated

1223
00:32:53.500 --> 00:32:54.260
with happiness.

1224
00:32:54.860 --> 00:32:56.760
So we have a basic idea of that.

1225
00:32:56.840 --> 00:32:58.060
The same thing is true with the

1226
00:32:58.060 --> 00:32:59.500
example of sex that you talked about

1227
00:32:59.500 --> 00:33:00.000
a minute ago.

1228
00:33:00.200 --> 00:33:01.740
It can be pleasure or it can

1229
00:33:01.740 --> 00:33:02.300
be enjoyment.

1230
00:33:02.720 --> 00:33:04.280
And everybody knows the difference

1231
00:33:04.280 --> 00:33:05.920
between sexual experiences that are

1232
00:33:05.920 --> 00:33:06.960
pleasurable or

1233
00:33:06.960 --> 00:33:07.540
enjoyable.

1234
00:33:08.660 --> 00:33:10.680
Enjoyment is the goal because that's

1235
00:33:10.680 --> 00:33:12.000
one of the macronutrients of happiness.

1236
00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:13.440
We talk about in terms, in the

1237
00:33:13.440 --> 00:33:15.060
terms that you defined about satisfaction,

1238
00:33:15.220 --> 00:33:15.420
but it's

1239
00:33:15.420 --> 00:33:17.560
really in this terminology.

1240
00:33:17.720 --> 00:33:18.620
And again, you know, you have to

1241
00:33:18.620 --> 00:33:19.500
just defining terms.

1242
00:33:19.580 --> 00:33:21.540
These are just words, but the concepts

1243
00:33:21.540 --> 00:33:23.240
underlying them are critical.

1244
00:33:23.480 --> 00:33:24.680
In the book, you give a really

1245
00:33:24.680 --> 00:33:27.760
good example of pleasure without enjoyment.

1246
00:33:27.980 --> 00:33:28.220
Yeah.

1247
00:33:28.560 --> 00:33:30.760
Which you mentioned obliquely a minute ago.

1248
00:33:30.860 --> 00:33:32.320
But when you think of a drug

1249
00:33:32.320 --> 00:33:34.340
addict, they're doing the drug.

1250
00:33:34.460 --> 00:33:34.620
Right.

1251
00:33:34.740 --> 00:33:36.020
They're theoretically getting the

1252
00:33:36.020 --> 00:33:37.020
pleasure, but they're not getting

1253
00:33:37.020 --> 00:33:38.040
any of the enjoyment.

1254
00:33:38.260 --> 00:33:38.360
Right.

1255
00:33:38.380 --> 00:33:39.500
They're getting tons of pleasure.

1256
00:33:39.500 --> 00:33:41.340
It's because they're loading only

1257
00:33:41.340 --> 00:33:44.020
on pleasure, but no enjoyment because

1258
00:33:44.020 --> 00:33:45.340
it's not social and

1259
00:33:45.340 --> 00:33:47.360
it actually is not engaging the prefrontal

1260
00:33:47.360 --> 00:33:49.340
cortex and the hippocampus to create memory.

1261
00:33:50.120 --> 00:33:52.620
And so you will, you simply will

1262
00:33:52.620 --> 00:33:54.300
have a transient experience and the

1263
00:33:54.300 --> 00:33:55.260
transient experience will

1264
00:33:55.260 --> 00:33:56.120
be unsatisfying.

1265
00:33:56.260 --> 00:33:57.340
And so you'll hit the lever again

1266
00:33:57.340 --> 00:33:58.340
and again and again and again, and

1267
00:33:58.340 --> 00:33:58.920
it will lower your

1268
00:33:58.920 --> 00:33:59.420
quality of life.

1269
00:33:59.620 --> 00:34:00.800
So that's the key thing.

1270
00:34:00.820 --> 00:34:02.360
If there's something you really, really love.

1271
00:34:02.960 --> 00:34:04.900
So for example, I'll ask people will

1272
00:34:04.900 --> 00:34:06.940
talk about, because I've done a lot

1273
00:34:06.940 --> 00:34:07.640
of work on the

1274
00:34:08.100 --> 00:34:08.920
science of addiction.

1275
00:34:08.920 --> 00:34:10.440
And it's a very interesting subject.

1276
00:34:10.640 --> 00:34:12.980
People say, how do you know if

1277
00:34:12.980 --> 00:34:13.420
you're addicted?

1278
00:34:13.540 --> 00:34:15.460
Because these are behavioral constructs.

1279
00:34:15.540 --> 00:34:16.380
You know, you can't take a blood

1280
00:34:16.380 --> 00:34:17.680
test to know if you're, if you're

1281
00:34:17.680 --> 00:34:19.140
an alcoholic, if you're,

1282
00:34:19.280 --> 00:34:21.340
you know, so it's, these are behavioral.

1283
00:34:21.340 --> 00:34:23.360
And the big behavioral thing is, do

1284
00:34:23.360 --> 00:34:24.700
you prefer to drink alone?

1285
00:34:25.320 --> 00:34:27.880
Do you prefer to actually become inebriated alone?

1286
00:34:28.360 --> 00:34:29.840
That means you're looking for pleasure

1287
00:34:29.840 --> 00:34:30.580
versus enjoyment.

1288
00:34:30.580 --> 00:34:32.520
And that is a, that has a

1289
00:34:32.520 --> 00:34:34.020
lot that will lead you more to

1290
00:34:34.020 --> 00:34:35.620
addiction, more toward addiction

1291
00:34:35.620 --> 00:34:37.500
and away from happiness is the way

1292
00:34:37.500 --> 00:34:37.980
that that works.

1293
00:34:37.980 --> 00:34:38.940
That's the reason that people say,

1294
00:34:39.100 --> 00:34:40.460
never drink alone, but they don't

1295
00:34:40.460 --> 00:34:40.860
know what they're

1296
00:34:40.860 --> 00:34:42.540
saying is they're saying, enjoy it.

1297
00:34:43.180 --> 00:34:44.280
Don't have it be a source of

1298
00:34:44.280 --> 00:34:46.320
pleasure because that's dangerous.

1299
00:34:46.520 --> 00:34:47.560
So that gives you an idea.

1300
00:34:47.680 --> 00:34:48.600
So we've talked a little bit about

1301
00:34:48.600 --> 00:34:49.940
satisfaction, like a little bit of enjoyment.

1302
00:34:50.180 --> 00:34:52.700
These are heavy, heavy topics in terms

1303
00:34:52.700 --> 00:34:53.940
of the social science and neuroscience

1304
00:34:53.940 --> 00:34:54.520
for sure.

1305
00:34:54.700 --> 00:34:56.300
And we haven't even touched on meaning,

1306
00:34:56.400 --> 00:34:57.660
which is the heaviest of them all,

1307
00:34:58.060 --> 00:34:58.420
which is the

1308
00:34:58.420 --> 00:34:59.380
hardest of them all.

1309
00:34:59.680 --> 00:35:02.120
So you can become an, what I

1310
00:35:02.120 --> 00:35:03.920
really want is I want people to

1311
00:35:03.920 --> 00:35:06.140
be, to be obsessed with,

1312
00:35:06.140 --> 00:35:08.140
to have their hobby be the science

1313
00:35:08.140 --> 00:35:09.540
of happiness and how they can get

1314
00:35:09.540 --> 00:35:10.360
it and spread it.

1315
00:35:10.840 --> 00:35:13.160
Because that would be a really meritorious movement.

1316
00:35:13.780 --> 00:35:15.560
If people were like, yeah, more of

1317
00:35:15.560 --> 00:35:17.560
the science, more understanding it.

1318
00:35:17.600 --> 00:35:19.160
I want to be excellent at this.

1319
00:35:19.220 --> 00:35:20.540
I want to be most excellent.

1320
00:35:21.100 --> 00:35:23.100
My hobby is getting better at happiness

1321
00:35:23.100 --> 00:35:25.900
and it's changed my life.

1322
00:35:26.280 --> 00:35:26.920
It's a good hobby.

1323
00:35:27.200 --> 00:35:28.860
It's really been a good hobby for me.

1324
00:35:29.500 --> 00:35:30.540
I made it into a career.

1325
00:35:31.060 --> 00:35:32.200
That you most certainly did.

1326
00:35:32.760 --> 00:35:33.920
So I want to close the loop

1327
00:35:33.920 --> 00:35:36.760
on the fulfillment recipe and get

1328
00:35:36.760 --> 00:35:37.300
your take on that.

1329
00:35:37.440 --> 00:35:39.240
So you have to work really hard

1330
00:35:39.240 --> 00:35:41.740
because that's just nature ensures

1331
00:35:41.740 --> 00:35:42.500
that you're going to do

1332
00:35:42.500 --> 00:35:44.360
that so that you're out doing the

1333
00:35:44.360 --> 00:35:45.600
hard things like getting a meal, protecting

1334
00:35:45.600 --> 00:35:46.040
your family,

1335
00:35:46.120 --> 00:35:49.160
et cetera, to acquire a set of skills.

1336
00:35:50.320 --> 00:35:52.840
That's a big lean on progress because

1337
00:35:52.840 --> 00:35:54.300
I agree progress, I think is a

1338
00:35:54.300 --> 00:35:55.060
foundational pillar

1339
00:35:55.060 --> 00:35:55.920
of human happiness.

1340
00:35:56.420 --> 00:35:57.640
So you're going to work really hard

1341
00:35:57.640 --> 00:35:59.000
to gain a set of skills that

1342
00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:00.700
allow you to serve yourself

1343
00:36:00.700 --> 00:36:01.580
and others.

1344
00:36:02.500 --> 00:36:04.420
And it needs to be in a

1345
00:36:04.420 --> 00:36:05.640
way that you find exciting.

1346
00:36:06.240 --> 00:36:09.320
So that to me is, those are

1347
00:36:09.320 --> 00:36:10.820
the things that nature is going to

1348
00:36:10.820 --> 00:36:12.060
ensure that you do.

1349
00:36:12.220 --> 00:36:14.800
And if you're doing it for not

1350
00:36:14.800 --> 00:36:17.180
only yourself, but others is the meaning

1351
00:36:17.180 --> 00:36:18.100
portion of this.

1352
00:36:20.240 --> 00:36:22.520
Why do, is it that people never

1353
00:36:22.520 --> 00:36:25.440
stop to identify what gives them meaning?

1354
00:36:25.620 --> 00:36:27.600
Is it that they confuse meaning?

1355
00:36:27.820 --> 00:36:29.540
Is that they're stuck in the me self?

1356
00:36:30.100 --> 00:36:33.000
Why do so few people end up

1357
00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:34.320
cracking that code?

1358
00:36:34.620 --> 00:36:35.640
Part of the reason is because they're

1359
00:36:35.640 --> 00:36:37.520
not specifically trying to find meaning.

1360
00:36:37.760 --> 00:36:38.760
They don't make it a goal.

1361
00:36:39.520 --> 00:36:41.320
They just, a lot of people believe

1362
00:36:41.320 --> 00:36:43.000
that if I do what I'm really,

1363
00:36:43.140 --> 00:36:43.800
really good at,

1364
00:36:44.020 --> 00:36:45.480
and I can be successful at, that

1365
00:36:45.480 --> 00:36:46.340
it's going to give me a ton

1366
00:36:46.340 --> 00:36:47.060
of meaning automatically.

1367
00:36:47.240 --> 00:36:48.060
And that's not right.

1368
00:36:48.360 --> 00:36:49.880
Like anything else, you have to do

1369
00:36:49.880 --> 00:36:50.780
things on purpose.

1370
00:36:50.980 --> 00:36:52.140
Did you get meaning when you were

1371
00:36:52.140 --> 00:36:52.960
a classical musician?

1372
00:36:53.400 --> 00:36:54.340
No, that was the reason.

1373
00:36:54.380 --> 00:36:55.600
That's the reason I'm not a classical musician.

1374
00:36:55.620 --> 00:36:56.900
Could you have gotten meaning out

1375
00:36:56.900 --> 00:36:57.100
of it?

1376
00:36:57.160 --> 00:36:59.220
Many people do, but here's the thing.

1377
00:36:59.220 --> 00:37:02.420
My favorite composer is Johann Sebastian Bach.

1378
00:37:02.580 --> 00:37:04.200
Maybe the greatest composer who ever lived.

1379
00:37:04.320 --> 00:37:04.860
That's a great story.

1380
00:37:05.120 --> 00:37:05.220
Yeah.

1381
00:37:05.440 --> 00:37:09.100
I mean, 1685 to 1750, 20 kids.

1382
00:37:09.680 --> 00:37:10.360
He had 20 kids?

1383
00:37:10.380 --> 00:37:12.340
Yeah, he was productive as a composer

1384
00:37:12.340 --> 00:37:13.040
and as a father.

1385
00:37:13.120 --> 00:37:13.420
I would say, was he Catholic?

1386
00:37:13.700 --> 00:37:16.740
He wasn't, he was Lutheran, but he was...

1387
00:37:17.480 --> 00:37:18.860
I say that because I know you're Catholic.

1388
00:37:18.920 --> 00:37:20.020
For those listening who wonder why

1389
00:37:20.020 --> 00:37:20.520
I made a joke about Catholicism.

1390
00:37:20.520 --> 00:37:21.680
He was just a sexy Lutheran.

1391
00:37:21.940 --> 00:37:25.100
But, and Bach was asked near the

1392
00:37:25.100 --> 00:37:26.460
end of his life why he wrote music.

1393
00:37:27.500 --> 00:37:28.380
The why question.

1394
00:37:28.380 --> 00:37:30.280
Our friend Simon Sinek always talks

1395
00:37:30.280 --> 00:37:31.020
about start with why.

1396
00:37:31.120 --> 00:37:31.840
And it's fantastic.

1397
00:37:32.040 --> 00:37:33.420
I mean, it's been, cause it really is.

1398
00:37:33.560 --> 00:37:35.880
People are going around asking what

1399
00:37:35.880 --> 00:37:37.640
and hoping to get the why for free.

1400
00:37:37.900 --> 00:37:40.320
And Simon's entrepreneurial twist

1401
00:37:40.320 --> 00:37:41.900
is start with why,

1402
00:37:42.360 --> 00:37:44.060
and then the what will come automatically.

1403
00:37:44.160 --> 00:37:45.540
And you'll be a lot more satisfied

1404
00:37:45.540 --> 00:37:46.720
because you'll find the source of meaning.

1405
00:37:46.860 --> 00:37:48.740
So Bach's why, when he was asked,

1406
00:37:48.920 --> 00:37:49.920
why do you write music?

1407
00:37:50.560 --> 00:37:52.020
Was the aim and final end of

1408
00:37:52.020 --> 00:37:53.840
all music is the refreshment of the soul

1409
00:37:53.840 --> 00:37:54.800
and the glorification of God.

1410
00:37:55.340 --> 00:37:55.980
Okay, not bad.

1411
00:37:56.360 --> 00:37:57.120
Not bad at all.

1412
00:37:57.120 --> 00:37:58.200
But I read that in my late

1413
00:37:58.200 --> 00:37:59.660
20s when I was still,

1414
00:37:59.760 --> 00:38:01.020
I was in the Barcelona Symphony in

1415
00:38:01.020 --> 00:38:01.440
those days.

1416
00:38:01.680 --> 00:38:02.480
And it was a good job.

1417
00:38:03.080 --> 00:38:04.520
And it was, you know, I love

1418
00:38:04.520 --> 00:38:04.900
the music.

1419
00:38:05.100 --> 00:38:05.920
I was really into it.

1420
00:38:06.040 --> 00:38:07.340
It's kind of a high prestige job,

1421
00:38:07.460 --> 00:38:09.080
you know, playing the greatest...

1422
00:38:09.080 --> 00:38:09.500
It sounds cool.

1423
00:38:09.600 --> 00:38:10.120
It sounds cool.

1424
00:38:10.180 --> 00:38:10.640
It sounds cool.

1425
00:38:10.820 --> 00:38:10.960
Yeah.

1426
00:38:11.680 --> 00:38:12.900
But I couldn't, I couldn't answer

1427
00:38:12.900 --> 00:38:13.360
like that.

1428
00:38:13.700 --> 00:38:14.740
I couldn't answer like that.

1429
00:38:14.920 --> 00:38:16.160
I didn't feel like I was refreshing

1430
00:38:16.160 --> 00:38:16.960
souls particularly.

1431
00:38:17.400 --> 00:38:18.440
I certainly didn't feel like I was

1432
00:38:18.440 --> 00:38:19.140
glorifying God.

1433
00:38:19.240 --> 00:38:19.540
I was gonna...

1434
00:38:19.540 --> 00:38:20.500
Could you have built that in though?

1435
00:38:20.600 --> 00:38:21.340
Cause this is one thing.

1436
00:38:21.420 --> 00:38:22.280
I always think people think they're

1437
00:38:22.280 --> 00:38:23.440
gonna find meaning.

1438
00:38:23.440 --> 00:38:24.380
It wasn't my thing.

1439
00:38:24.840 --> 00:38:25.980
It just wasn't my thing.

1440
00:38:25.980 --> 00:38:28.920
And so I went in search of

1441
00:38:28.920 --> 00:38:30.920
something where I could answer my

1442
00:38:30.920 --> 00:38:32.360
why question like Bach.

1443
00:38:33.640 --> 00:38:35.480
I became a social scientist.

1444
00:38:36.320 --> 00:38:36.920
That was the thing?

1445
00:38:36.920 --> 00:38:37.280
That was it.

1446
00:38:37.440 --> 00:38:38.260
Because, you know, when I...

1447
00:38:38.260 --> 00:38:40.160
Because after that, you also, you

1448
00:38:40.160 --> 00:38:42.440
go on to run the think tank

1449
00:38:42.440 --> 00:38:43.300
after that, right?

1450
00:38:43.300 --> 00:38:43.840
Right. Yeah.

1451
00:38:43.880 --> 00:38:44.740
So I got my PhD.

1452
00:38:44.980 --> 00:38:46.260
I actually finished college a month

1453
00:38:46.260 --> 00:38:48.520
before my 30th birthday by correspondence.

1454
00:38:48.980 --> 00:38:50.960
So this is not a typical path

1455
00:38:50.960 --> 00:38:52.620
to, you know, a professorship at Harvard.

1456
00:38:53.120 --> 00:38:54.740
Obviously, this is not typically the

1457
00:38:54.740 --> 00:38:55.300
way it gets done.

1458
00:38:55.300 --> 00:38:56.420
This is a great country, isn't it?

1459
00:38:57.080 --> 00:38:57.380
I agree.

1460
00:38:57.680 --> 00:38:57.980
Yeah.

1461
00:38:59.520 --> 00:39:01.620
A kid from Puyallup can do this.

1462
00:39:02.140 --> 00:39:02.720
It's fantastic.

1463
00:39:02.920 --> 00:39:03.000
Crazy.

1464
00:39:03.220 --> 00:39:03.780
I love that.

1465
00:39:04.120 --> 00:39:06.140
So, and then I went and I

1466
00:39:06.140 --> 00:39:07.660
got so interested when I was doing

1467
00:39:07.660 --> 00:39:10.200
my bachelor's degree in human behavior

1468
00:39:10.200 --> 00:39:11.640
and the fact that you can model

1469
00:39:11.640 --> 00:39:13.440
it and you can study it that

1470
00:39:13.440 --> 00:39:15.280
I went back and got my master's

1471
00:39:15.280 --> 00:39:17.400
and PhD as a social scientist, as

1472
00:39:17.400 --> 00:39:18.800
a quantitative social scientist.

1473
00:39:18.960 --> 00:39:19.700
I was doing...

1474
00:39:19.700 --> 00:39:21.180
For a living, I was doing military

1475
00:39:21.180 --> 00:39:23.800
operations research at the RAND Corporation for,

1476
00:39:23.800 --> 00:39:25.680
you know, like secret stuff for the

1477
00:39:25.680 --> 00:39:26.720
Air Force and all that.

1478
00:39:26.900 --> 00:39:27.680
But, you know, using...

1479
00:39:27.680 --> 00:39:29.120
And you felt the sense of meaning

1480
00:39:29.120 --> 00:39:29.580
in all that?

1481
00:39:29.760 --> 00:39:31.060
I was, what I felt the sense

1482
00:39:31.060 --> 00:39:32.580
of meaning in was I was learning

1483
00:39:32.580 --> 00:39:33.500
so much that was

1484
00:39:33.500 --> 00:39:34.380
so critically interesting.

1485
00:39:34.380 --> 00:39:36.200
And I had a strong sense that

1486
00:39:36.200 --> 00:39:37.160
I was going to, I was learning

1487
00:39:37.160 --> 00:39:37.880
how to

1488
00:39:38.760 --> 00:39:40.840
ask and answer original questions

1489
00:39:40.840 --> 00:39:41.880
about human behavior that are going

1490
00:39:41.880 --> 00:39:42.960
to push the boundary

1491
00:39:43.980 --> 00:39:45.840
of what we knew so that people's

1492
00:39:45.840 --> 00:39:46.540
lives could get better.

1493
00:39:46.620 --> 00:39:48.420
I had a very strong sense that

1494
00:39:48.420 --> 00:39:49.280
it was going to, it was in

1495
00:39:49.280 --> 00:39:49.700
the offing.

1496
00:39:49.740 --> 00:39:50.600
It was going to take decades.

1497
00:39:50.820 --> 00:39:52.920
Was the part about so people's lives

1498
00:39:52.920 --> 00:39:53.480
could be better?

1499
00:39:53.480 --> 00:39:55.220
Was that a critical part of that?

1500
00:39:55.380 --> 00:39:56.080
It was a critical thing.

1501
00:39:56.240 --> 00:39:57.780
To earn my success, I needed to

1502
00:39:57.780 --> 00:39:59.600
do something where my work created value

1503
00:39:59.600 --> 00:40:00.720
in my life and the life of

1504
00:40:00.720 --> 00:40:01.160
other people.

1505
00:40:01.960 --> 00:40:02.600
That's what I felt like I needed

1506
00:40:02.600 --> 00:40:02.600
to do.

1507
00:40:02.600 --> 00:40:03.360
I think that that is so big.

1508
00:40:03.440 --> 00:40:04.480
And look, you cover this in the book.

1509
00:40:04.540 --> 00:40:05.660
So I know this isn't mysterious to

1510
00:40:05.660 --> 00:40:07.940
you, but focusing outward.

1511
00:40:08.120 --> 00:40:09.280
Like if you want to be happy,

1512
00:40:09.700 --> 00:40:11.640
we don't need, this is me paraphrasing

1513
00:40:11.640 --> 00:40:12.020
you again.

1514
00:40:12.200 --> 00:40:13.580
We don't need self-care.

1515
00:40:13.720 --> 00:40:14.520
We need other care.

1516
00:40:14.680 --> 00:40:14.840
Right.

1517
00:40:15.480 --> 00:40:19.540
And I just have learned through unfortunate

1518
00:40:19.540 --> 00:40:20.340
trial and error

1519
00:40:20.340 --> 00:40:22.480
that if I'm doing something only for

1520
00:40:22.480 --> 00:40:26.440
me, I'll run ashore on the me,

1521
00:40:26.480 --> 00:40:26.900
me, me problem.

1522
00:40:27.380 --> 00:40:27.580
Totally.

1523
00:40:27.760 --> 00:40:28.420
And so you get into the me

1524
00:40:28.420 --> 00:40:28.980
-self world.

1525
00:40:29.380 --> 00:40:30.460
It's all me-self.

1526
00:40:31.020 --> 00:40:32.500
You know, other care is I-self.

1527
00:40:32.860 --> 00:40:33.980
It's I'm going to look outward at

1528
00:40:33.980 --> 00:40:34.880
what other people need.

1529
00:40:34.960 --> 00:40:36.360
I'm going to be thinking more about

1530
00:40:36.360 --> 00:40:38.020
them, which gets me away from the

1531
00:40:38.800 --> 00:40:41.760
boring, repetitive tedium of the me,

1532
00:40:41.800 --> 00:40:43.860
me, me soundtrack to begin with.

1533
00:40:43.920 --> 00:40:44.680
I mean, it has, I mean, it's

1534
00:40:44.680 --> 00:40:45.400
just simple.

1535
00:40:45.640 --> 00:40:47.520
You're distracted from the stuff that's

1536
00:40:47.520 --> 00:40:48.020
so boring.

1537
00:40:48.020 --> 00:40:50.720
And yet, so you look at so

1538
00:40:50.720 --> 00:40:52.720
obsessively over the course of your life.

1539
00:40:52.780 --> 00:40:54.200
So that's critically important.

1540
00:40:54.260 --> 00:40:55.400
And you find, I mean, again, there's

1541
00:40:55.400 --> 00:40:57.160
tons and tons of studies that actually

1542
00:40:57.160 --> 00:40:57.620
show that the

1543
00:40:57.620 --> 00:40:58.900
more you give, the happier you get.

1544
00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:00.680
The more you give, the richer you get.

1545
00:41:01.100 --> 00:41:02.720
The more you give, the better looking

1546
00:41:02.720 --> 00:41:03.380
you are.

1547
00:41:03.700 --> 00:41:05.300
It's a wonderful study.

1548
00:41:05.380 --> 00:41:05.540
What?

1549
00:41:05.640 --> 00:41:06.200
It's all perception.

1550
00:41:06.400 --> 00:41:07.940
So there's this one study where these

1551
00:41:07.940 --> 00:41:09.520
guys, these social psychologists,

1552
00:41:09.700 --> 00:41:10.760
they bring men.

1553
00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:13.180
It's men in the lab who are partnered.

1554
00:41:13.760 --> 00:41:14.940
And it's all heterosexual couples.

1555
00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:15.540
And they bring them in.

1556
00:41:15.540 --> 00:41:17.080
Some have been dating for six months

1557
00:41:17.080 --> 00:41:18.340
and some have been married for 50 years.

1558
00:41:18.820 --> 00:41:19.960
And that the guys in white lab

1559
00:41:19.960 --> 00:41:21.420
coats and they say, okay, it's a

1560
00:41:21.420 --> 00:41:22.120
simple experiment.

1561
00:41:22.380 --> 00:41:23.580
I'm going to, sir, I'm going to

1562
00:41:23.580 --> 00:41:24.720
give you these coins, put them in

1563
00:41:24.720 --> 00:41:25.120
your pocket.

1564
00:41:25.560 --> 00:41:27.800
You and your wife or girlfriend, you're

1565
00:41:27.800 --> 00:41:29.120
going to walk down this little path

1566
00:41:29.120 --> 00:41:29.540
to that other

1567
00:41:29.540 --> 00:41:30.240
building down there.

1568
00:41:30.480 --> 00:41:32.520
And my colleague is going to interview you.

1569
00:41:32.620 --> 00:41:33.980
And then you get to keep the money.

1570
00:41:34.340 --> 00:41:34.780
That's it.

1571
00:41:35.740 --> 00:41:37.160
So I walked down this little path

1572
00:41:37.160 --> 00:41:39.060
outside and there's an alleyway between

1573
00:41:39.060 --> 00:41:39.600
the buildings.

1574
00:41:39.600 --> 00:41:41.740
And this homeless guy comes ambling

1575
00:41:41.740 --> 00:41:44.960
out of the alley and panhandles the

1576
00:41:44.960 --> 00:41:46.080
husband or boyfriend.

1577
00:41:46.280 --> 00:41:48.120
He's a confederate to the experiment, obviously.

1578
00:41:48.660 --> 00:41:49.840
He says, hey, you got some change?

1579
00:41:50.220 --> 00:41:50.860
He does.

1580
00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:51.980
They know he does because they put

1581
00:41:51.980 --> 00:41:52.720
the money in his pocket.

1582
00:41:52.860 --> 00:41:53.740
And he has to make a decision

1583
00:41:53.740 --> 00:41:55.620
in front of his wife on whether

1584
00:41:55.620 --> 00:41:56.240
he's going to help the

1585
00:41:56.240 --> 00:41:56.700
homeless guy.

1586
00:41:57.300 --> 00:41:58.440
They get to the other building.

1587
00:41:58.660 --> 00:42:00.040
And the first question in the interview

1588
00:42:00.040 --> 00:42:01.540
is, did you help the homeless guy?

1589
00:42:01.920 --> 00:42:02.780
How much did you give him?

1590
00:42:02.800 --> 00:42:04.040
And then the second question is to

1591
00:42:04.040 --> 00:42:05.960
the wife, how attractive do you find

1592
00:42:05.960 --> 00:42:06.500
him right now?

1593
00:42:07.020 --> 00:42:08.540
The more you support the homeless

1594
00:42:08.540 --> 00:42:10.240
guy, the hotter she finds you.

1595
00:42:10.520 --> 00:42:11.600
That's so interesting.

1596
00:42:11.940 --> 00:42:13.340
That's the reason on a first date,

1597
00:42:13.760 --> 00:42:15.460
you're like, I love humanity.

1598
00:42:15.760 --> 00:42:18.380
I support, you know, I build houses

1599
00:42:18.380 --> 00:42:19.240
for the poor.

1600
00:42:19.520 --> 00:42:20.640
I love dogs.

1601
00:42:20.740 --> 00:42:21.520
I love babies.

1602
00:42:21.540 --> 00:42:22.680
You're trying to look like, you know,

1603
00:42:22.760 --> 00:42:24.500
Albert Schweitzer on a first date.

1604
00:42:24.560 --> 00:42:25.160
That's hilarious.

1605
00:42:25.400 --> 00:42:26.840
Because you're more handsome.

1606
00:42:27.560 --> 00:42:29.400
That is very interesting.

1607
00:42:29.740 --> 00:42:29.920
Okay.

1608
00:42:30.020 --> 00:42:33.680
So we know that being outward focus

1609
00:42:33.680 --> 00:42:34.820
is going to be beneficial.

1610
00:42:35.400 --> 00:42:38.240
But you were talking about you needed

1611
00:42:38.240 --> 00:42:39.500
to find the answer to your why.

1612
00:42:39.600 --> 00:42:40.440
What is going to be that thing

1613
00:42:40.440 --> 00:42:41.520
that I could answer in the way

1614
00:42:41.520 --> 00:42:42.160
that Bach does?

1615
00:42:42.260 --> 00:42:44.400
I find in life, basically, nobody

1616
00:42:44.400 --> 00:42:45.020
finds that.

1617
00:42:45.260 --> 00:42:47.220
Like that is so rare.

1618
00:42:47.940 --> 00:42:49.280
And when they do find it, it

1619
00:42:49.280 --> 00:42:50.280
ends up being very transient.

1620
00:42:50.800 --> 00:42:52.380
So how did you navigate?

1621
00:42:52.500 --> 00:42:53.980
Because for people that don't know,

1622
00:42:54.100 --> 00:42:55.460
we did another interview, which I

1623
00:42:55.460 --> 00:42:56.060
highly encourage

1624
00:42:56.060 --> 00:42:56.680
them to go watch.

1625
00:42:56.720 --> 00:42:57.280
And so we covered this.

1626
00:42:57.380 --> 00:42:58.580
I don't want to tread a ton

1627
00:42:58.580 --> 00:42:59.140
of the same ground.

1628
00:42:59.280 --> 00:43:01.660
But I think it's worth telling people,

1629
00:43:02.280 --> 00:43:03.980
would you say that your career has

1630
00:43:03.980 --> 00:43:04.440
been spiral?

1631
00:43:04.440 --> 00:43:05.420
Yeah, for sure.

1632
00:43:05.540 --> 00:43:05.680
Okay.

1633
00:43:05.800 --> 00:43:06.980
You gave me the language.

1634
00:43:07.100 --> 00:43:08.320
Mine has for sure.

1635
00:43:10.020 --> 00:43:10.740
It's interesting.

1636
00:43:10.840 --> 00:43:12.320
You make me question whether that's

1637
00:43:12.320 --> 00:43:13.320
just my personality.

1638
00:43:13.320 --> 00:43:14.200
And I was going to end up

1639
00:43:14.200 --> 00:43:16.080
there no matter what, or if it

1640
00:43:16.080 --> 00:43:18.280
really was what I, the story

1641
00:43:18.280 --> 00:43:19.820
I've told myself my entire life, which

1642
00:43:19.820 --> 00:43:20.860
is I did all of this just

1643
00:43:20.860 --> 00:43:21.640
to get into storytelling

1644
00:43:21.640 --> 00:43:23.020
and I needed to control the assets.

1645
00:43:23.840 --> 00:43:24.860
Maybe we'll get into that.

1646
00:43:24.860 --> 00:43:27.040
Well, those are endogenous to each other.

1647
00:43:27.060 --> 00:43:27.420
Yeah, maybe.

1648
00:43:27.860 --> 00:43:29.640
But what I want to know now

1649
00:43:29.640 --> 00:43:33.700
is, did your why run out?

1650
00:43:33.700 --> 00:43:36.000
And that's why you reinvented yourself?

1651
00:43:36.620 --> 00:43:37.980
Did it just migrate?

1652
00:43:38.140 --> 00:43:40.160
Like, how have you kept that alive

1653
00:43:40.160 --> 00:43:41.000
in your life?

1654
00:43:41.300 --> 00:43:43.500
I took opportunities that were put

1655
00:43:43.500 --> 00:43:44.980
in my path that I thought were

1656
00:43:44.980 --> 00:43:46.040
in line with this

1657
00:43:46.040 --> 00:43:47.400
vision of how I was trying to grow.

1658
00:43:47.800 --> 00:43:49.580
So I had an intention, but I

1659
00:43:49.580 --> 00:43:50.200
didn't have attachment.

1660
00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:51.920
So when I was a French horn

1661
00:43:51.920 --> 00:43:53.980
player, leaving that and becoming

1662
00:43:53.980 --> 00:43:55.720
a social scientist, I had

1663
00:43:55.720 --> 00:43:57.640
an intention to do this work on

1664
00:43:57.640 --> 00:44:01.100
human behavior to help myself and

1665
00:44:01.100 --> 00:44:02.720
others, to make life better,

1666
00:44:02.720 --> 00:44:04.840
to increase love and happiness in

1667
00:44:04.840 --> 00:44:05.460
other people's lives.

1668
00:44:05.780 --> 00:44:07.300
But I was not attached to what

1669
00:44:07.300 --> 00:44:08.540
manifestation that was going to take.

1670
00:44:08.600 --> 00:44:10.120
And that's what I urge all young

1671
00:44:10.120 --> 00:44:12.160
people to do, to have a virtuous,

1672
00:44:12.520 --> 00:44:13.500
beautiful intention

1673
00:44:13.500 --> 00:44:15.140
without attachment with respect to

1674
00:44:15.140 --> 00:44:16.480
the expression that it's going to

1675
00:44:16.480 --> 00:44:17.140
take at any particular

1676
00:44:17.140 --> 00:44:17.540
time.

1677
00:44:17.780 --> 00:44:19.100
I taught for a number of years.

1678
00:44:19.160 --> 00:44:19.600
I loved it.

1679
00:44:19.760 --> 00:44:20.360
Super great.

1680
00:44:20.940 --> 00:44:22.600
And then I thought, I should run

1681
00:44:22.600 --> 00:44:24.940
something that I think is going to

1682
00:44:24.940 --> 00:44:26.780
be good for humanity

1683
00:44:26.780 --> 00:44:28.680
and for society, you know?

1684
00:44:28.680 --> 00:44:30.520
I ran this think tank, this big

1685
00:44:30.520 --> 00:44:31.460
think tank in Washington, D.C.

1686
00:44:31.500 --> 00:44:33.240
I have 300 employees, mostly just

1687
00:44:33.240 --> 00:44:33.880
raised money.

1688
00:44:33.940 --> 00:44:35.200
I had to raise $50 million a

1689
00:44:35.200 --> 00:44:36.260
year to keep the doors open.

1690
00:44:36.780 --> 00:44:38.760
And it was a thrilling experience.

1691
00:44:38.760 --> 00:44:40.260
It was exhausting to be sure.

1692
00:44:40.360 --> 00:44:41.500
But what I was trying to do

1693
00:44:41.500 --> 00:44:43.040
was to use my background as a

1694
00:44:43.040 --> 00:44:44.040
social scientist to create

1695
00:44:44.040 --> 00:44:45.620
better public policy, to hire really

1696
00:44:45.620 --> 00:44:48.060
good people that was going to make

1697
00:44:48.060 --> 00:44:48.560
the country

1698
00:44:48.560 --> 00:44:50.220
and the world freer and better with

1699
00:44:50.220 --> 00:44:52.360
an emphasis on opportunity for people

1700
00:44:52.360 --> 00:44:53.120
at the margins of

1701
00:44:53.120 --> 00:44:54.700
society, which is what my think tank

1702
00:44:54.700 --> 00:44:55.640
was engaged in.

1703
00:44:55.640 --> 00:44:58.360
After about 10 years, I knew I

1704
00:44:58.360 --> 00:44:59.260
was getting stale, man.

1705
00:44:59.560 --> 00:45:00.400
I was getting stale.

1706
00:45:00.560 --> 00:45:02.260
So I had the same intention, but

1707
00:45:02.260 --> 00:45:04.820
I had no attachment to Arthur Brooks,

1708
00:45:05.140 --> 00:45:05.960
president of

1709
00:45:05.960 --> 00:45:07.020
the American Enterprise Institute.

1710
00:45:07.180 --> 00:45:09.240
That would be a disordered attachment

1711
00:45:09.240 --> 00:45:11.200
because that's not who I am.

1712
00:45:11.620 --> 00:45:12.540
I'm Arthur Brooks.

1713
00:45:12.760 --> 00:45:13.540
I'm a husband.

1714
00:45:13.720 --> 00:45:14.140
I'm a father.

1715
00:45:14.220 --> 00:45:14.900
I'm a child of God.

1716
00:45:15.180 --> 00:45:17.320
And I am put on earth to

1717
00:45:17.320 --> 00:45:18.880
lift people up in bonds of love

1718
00:45:18.880 --> 00:45:20.240
and happiness using science

1719
00:45:20.240 --> 00:45:20.680
and ideas.

1720
00:45:21.160 --> 00:45:22.400
What's the next assignment?

1721
00:45:22.860 --> 00:45:23.960
What's the next assignment?

1722
00:45:23.960 --> 00:45:26.520
And the next assignment was to do

1723
00:45:26.520 --> 00:45:27.560
what I do now, which is I

1724
00:45:27.560 --> 00:45:28.940
have a company that teaches,

1725
00:45:29.080 --> 00:45:30.880
writes, speaks and teaches widely

1726
00:45:30.880 --> 00:45:32.880
and does media on the science of

1727
00:45:32.880 --> 00:45:34.220
happiness to popularize,

1728
00:45:34.280 --> 00:45:36.640
to see the world as a classroom

1729
00:45:36.640 --> 00:45:39.440
and an enormous course of study of

1730
00:45:39.440 --> 00:45:40.220
the science of happiness

1731
00:45:40.220 --> 00:45:41.220
to lift people up.

1732
00:45:41.740 --> 00:45:42.960
And that, you know, so I can

1733
00:45:42.960 --> 00:45:45.100
write a column in Atlantic and I

1734
00:45:45.100 --> 00:45:46.100
read books and I get to

1735
00:45:46.100 --> 00:45:47.820
talk to you and I get to

1736
00:45:47.820 --> 00:45:48.600
travel and speak.

1737
00:45:48.740 --> 00:45:50.400
I teach at Harvard and it's phenomenal.

1738
00:45:50.400 --> 00:45:53.780
But that's not, I'm not attached because

1739
00:45:53.780 --> 00:45:55.160
I know this is not the last assignment.

1740
00:45:55.700 --> 00:45:57.260
I have intention, but the attachment,

1741
00:45:57.420 --> 00:45:58.140
no, no, no, no, no, no.

1742
00:45:58.140 --> 00:46:00.000
The attachment is the killer of all

1743
00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:00.440
of these things.

1744
00:46:00.500 --> 00:46:01.180
And you too.

1745
00:46:01.460 --> 00:46:03.520
It's like, next assignment, please.

1746
00:46:04.080 --> 00:46:05.660
But here's the direction we're going in.

1747
00:46:05.760 --> 00:46:06.900
I need to do this thing.

1748
00:46:07.020 --> 00:46:08.200
This thing is going to serve.

1749
00:46:08.440 --> 00:46:10.060
And when you're really in the zone,

1750
00:46:10.400 --> 00:46:12.900
it's a thrill.

1751
00:46:13.640 --> 00:46:14.500
It's a thrill.

1752
00:46:14.640 --> 00:46:15.640
You just can't get it off of

1753
00:46:15.640 --> 00:46:17.300
it when you're really in the zone too.

1754
00:46:17.360 --> 00:46:18.620
But it's not because you're going

1755
00:46:18.620 --> 00:46:19.260
for the thrill.

1756
00:46:19.260 --> 00:46:21.200
It's because you're going for the value.

1757
00:46:21.620 --> 00:46:22.920
You want the, you want to hit

1758
00:46:22.920 --> 00:46:25.180
that vein of value, right?

1759
00:46:25.220 --> 00:46:26.520
And when you run that vein out,

1760
00:46:26.580 --> 00:46:27.700
then you go look for it.

1761
00:46:27.740 --> 00:46:28.540
You dig a new mine.

1762
00:46:28.860 --> 00:46:29.880
What does it mean to run the

1763
00:46:29.880 --> 00:46:30.440
vein out though?

1764
00:46:30.700 --> 00:46:33.680
So, okay.

1765
00:46:34.060 --> 00:46:39.000
How pure was your move into the

1766
00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:40.200
think tank?

1767
00:46:40.480 --> 00:46:42.320
Because you talk about idols.

1768
00:46:43.260 --> 00:46:44.700
I've listened to enough of your content.

1769
00:46:44.820 --> 00:46:46.420
I know what your idol is.

1770
00:46:47.280 --> 00:46:49.820
I think we share an idol.

1771
00:46:53.560 --> 00:46:55.240
So, nothing is either good or bad,

1772
00:46:55.300 --> 00:46:56.340
but thinking makes it so.

1773
00:46:56.700 --> 00:46:58.320
So, I don't know that having an

1774
00:46:58.320 --> 00:46:59.000
idol is bad.

1775
00:46:59.100 --> 00:47:00.380
I have a feeling that it's nature's

1776
00:47:00.380 --> 00:47:01.700
way of getting us moving

1777
00:47:01.700 --> 00:47:03.160
and making us an active species.

1778
00:47:03.540 --> 00:47:04.560
And it is how we use it

1779
00:47:04.560 --> 00:47:05.220
for great good.

1780
00:47:05.620 --> 00:47:07.640
But if it's the end goal, if

1781
00:47:07.640 --> 00:47:09.480
an idol of money or power

1782
00:47:09.480 --> 00:47:11.700
or pleasure or fame is the end goal,

1783
00:47:11.860 --> 00:47:12.760
we'll be onto you and we'll be

1784
00:47:12.760 --> 00:47:13.360
onto the world.

1785
00:47:13.360 --> 00:47:16.320
But if it's an intermediate goal to

1786
00:47:16.320 --> 00:47:17.040
lifting people up

1787
00:47:17.040 --> 00:47:18.560
and bringing them together, if you

1788
00:47:18.560 --> 00:47:19.800
can use the prestige

1789
00:47:19.800 --> 00:47:21.420
that you have in your job and

1790
00:47:21.420 --> 00:47:22.700
the admiration of other people

1791
00:47:22.700 --> 00:47:23.940
to get them interested in something

1792
00:47:23.940 --> 00:47:25.020
that's truly generative

1793
00:47:25.020 --> 00:47:26.160
and good and improve their lives,

1794
00:47:26.220 --> 00:47:26.780
which by the way,

1795
00:47:26.780 --> 00:47:28.400
you're doing with the show, right?

1796
00:47:28.420 --> 00:47:29.280
I mean, you've got lots of prestige,

1797
00:47:29.340 --> 00:47:30.000
you're a famous guy,

1798
00:47:30.200 --> 00:47:31.720
but you're using it so that people

1799
00:47:31.720 --> 00:47:32.360
will watch it

1800
00:47:32.360 --> 00:47:33.220
and change their lives.

1801
00:47:33.640 --> 00:47:35.560
So, this is the end goal to problem.

1802
00:47:35.800 --> 00:47:37.240
If it's an intermediate goal, then

1803
00:47:37.240 --> 00:47:37.580
it's good.

1804
00:47:37.800 --> 00:47:41.000
I want to restate this in my language

1805
00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:42.400
to see if I really understand this.

1806
00:47:43.080 --> 00:47:45.740
Okay, so the me self is getting

1807
00:47:45.740 --> 00:47:47.180
caught up in my emotions.

1808
00:47:47.180 --> 00:47:52.060
I'm confusing the emotion for the

1809
00:47:52.060 --> 00:47:54.400
perception of the emotion.

1810
00:47:54.700 --> 00:47:58.240
So, knowing that in the brain, pain

1811
00:47:58.240 --> 00:47:58.760
and suffering

1812
00:47:58.760 --> 00:48:01.760
are two separate spaces, knowing literally

1813
00:48:01.760 --> 00:48:03.000
two different regions of the brain,

1814
00:48:03.260 --> 00:48:04.700
not making that up for people listening.

1815
00:48:05.240 --> 00:48:08.500
And then in meditation, I am to

1816
00:48:08.500 --> 00:48:09.400
your point earlier

1817
00:48:09.400 --> 00:48:11.440
about the bitter coffee.

1818
00:48:11.440 --> 00:48:15.600
There's a difference between my knee hurts

1819
00:48:16.480 --> 00:48:19.420
and witnessing that I'm having a sensation

1820
00:48:19.420 --> 00:48:20.060
in my knee

1821
00:48:20.060 --> 00:48:21.880
that one might articulate that pain.

1822
00:48:21.880 --> 00:48:22.660
But my knee hurts versus I don't

1823
00:48:22.660 --> 00:48:23.700
like how my knee feels.

1824
00:48:23.740 --> 00:48:24.000
Right.

1825
00:48:24.260 --> 00:48:25.560
That's really a big difference because,

1826
00:48:25.640 --> 00:48:25.740
you know,

1827
00:48:25.780 --> 00:48:26.380
it's my knee hurts.

1828
00:48:26.680 --> 00:48:27.740
That's a statement of fact.

1829
00:48:27.820 --> 00:48:28.040
Right.

1830
00:48:28.380 --> 00:48:29.240
Right, it's a signal.

1831
00:48:29.740 --> 00:48:31.460
And the one last thing I'll wrap

1832
00:48:31.460 --> 00:48:31.760
on that

1833
00:48:31.760 --> 00:48:32.940
to see if I really get this.

1834
00:48:33.160 --> 00:48:35.440
So, Viktor Frankl talked about the gap

1835
00:48:35.440 --> 00:48:37.000
between stimulus and response.

1836
00:48:37.200 --> 00:48:38.160
Now, for people that haven't heard

1837
00:48:38.160 --> 00:48:38.620
that name,

1838
00:48:38.800 --> 00:48:40.500
he was in a concentration camp, lost

1839
00:48:40.500 --> 00:48:41.000
his wife,

1840
00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:43.200
mom, dad, I mean, just unimaginable

1841
00:48:43.200 --> 00:48:43.760
amounts of loss.

1842
00:48:44.840 --> 00:48:44.960
His whole family, right.

1843
00:48:44.960 --> 00:48:47.540
And came out of it, psychiatrist,

1844
00:48:47.820 --> 00:48:49.360
came out, or actually, I think a neuroscientist.

1845
00:48:49.480 --> 00:48:51.040
Psychiatrist, and he was a psychiatrist

1846
00:48:51.040 --> 00:48:52.460
and a psychoanalyst.

1847
00:48:52.620 --> 00:48:52.860
Okay.

1848
00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:54.120
Which is an interesting combination.

1849
00:48:54.340 --> 00:48:55.120
Very interesting.

1850
00:48:55.540 --> 00:48:59.100
Writes a book about that time, basically saying,

1851
00:48:59.200 --> 00:49:03.120
if you could find meaning in your suffering,

1852
00:49:03.440 --> 00:49:04.380
that you could make it.

1853
00:49:04.480 --> 00:49:05.760
But if you lost that sense, he

1854
00:49:05.760 --> 00:49:05.960
was like,

1855
00:49:05.980 --> 00:49:07.320
you could literally predict when somebody

1856
00:49:07.320 --> 00:49:07.780
would die

1857
00:49:07.780 --> 00:49:08.820
because once they gave up

1858
00:49:08.820 --> 00:49:10.400
and they could no longer associate meaning

1859
00:49:10.400 --> 00:49:11.660
with why they were going through the suffering,

1860
00:49:11.780 --> 00:49:12.180
that was it.

1861
00:49:12.700 --> 00:49:14.340
And so, that idea of there's this gap

1862
00:49:14.340 --> 00:49:15.560
between stimulus and response,

1863
00:49:15.620 --> 00:49:17.600
and you get to decide how you

1864
00:49:17.600 --> 00:49:18.320
interpret that thing

1865
00:49:18.320 --> 00:49:18.940
is everything.

1866
00:49:19.140 --> 00:49:19.320
Right.

1867
00:49:19.600 --> 00:49:20.220
Is that what you're talking about?

1868
00:49:20.240 --> 00:49:22.040
When that gap goes away, you're now

1869
00:49:22.040 --> 00:49:22.900
in me territory.

1870
00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:23.160
Yeah.

1871
00:49:23.340 --> 00:49:25.800
So, there's so much in this.

1872
00:49:25.980 --> 00:49:28.080
And we've referred to the new book.

1873
00:49:28.320 --> 00:49:29.940
And the whole front part of this

1874
00:49:29.940 --> 00:49:30.280
new book

1875
00:49:30.280 --> 00:49:32.120
is emotional self-management based

1876
00:49:32.120 --> 00:49:33.760
on the science

1877
00:49:33.760 --> 00:49:35.500
of how your brain gives you signals

1878
00:49:35.500 --> 00:49:36.600
that are called emotions.

1879
00:49:37.220 --> 00:49:39.360
Getting away from the idea that bad emotions

1880
00:49:39.360 --> 00:49:40.820
are unfortunate, we should get rid

1881
00:49:40.820 --> 00:49:41.120
of them.

1882
00:49:41.460 --> 00:49:44.020
Or that unhappiness for them is bad,

1883
00:49:44.060 --> 00:49:45.000
and we should get rid of it.

1884
00:49:45.120 --> 00:49:46.500
So, understanding the science of how

1885
00:49:46.500 --> 00:49:46.900
this works

1886
00:49:46.900 --> 00:49:47.780
and what these things are for,

1887
00:49:47.900 --> 00:49:49.660
and then being able to learn, grow,

1888
00:49:49.740 --> 00:49:52.060
and manage the feelings that we want

1889
00:49:52.060 --> 00:49:54.140
such that we can adapt best to

1890
00:49:54.140 --> 00:49:55.260
the current world,

1891
00:49:55.380 --> 00:49:57.740
and we can make growth toward happierness.

1892
00:49:58.520 --> 00:50:00.520
That's the whole front part of this book.

1893
00:50:00.680 --> 00:50:02.180
The back half is, okay, now that

1894
00:50:02.180 --> 00:50:02.620
you've done that.

1895
00:50:02.640 --> 00:50:03.400
Build the life you want.

1896
00:50:03.420 --> 00:50:04.160
Build the life you want.

1897
00:50:04.420 --> 00:50:05.720
Co-authored with Oprah Winfrey.

1898
00:50:05.760 --> 00:50:06.260
Exactly right.

1899
00:50:06.400 --> 00:50:06.940
Exactly right.

1900
00:50:07.080 --> 00:50:07.760
It's a good book, by the way.

1901
00:50:07.900 --> 00:50:08.880
I'm glad you like it.

1902
00:50:08.900 --> 00:50:09.180
Thank you.

1903
00:50:09.180 --> 00:50:11.440
It was a joy to write it.

1904
00:50:11.500 --> 00:50:12.520
It's a joy writing a book with

1905
00:50:12.520 --> 00:50:13.200
Oprah Winfrey, too.

1906
00:50:13.260 --> 00:50:13.920
What an experience.

1907
00:50:14.280 --> 00:50:15.700
It was really an interesting experience.

1908
00:50:15.960 --> 00:50:18.520
And recording the book, the audio

1909
00:50:18.520 --> 00:50:19.000
book, too,

1910
00:50:19.540 --> 00:50:20.480
because you keep thinking,

1911
00:50:20.800 --> 00:50:21.700
oh, I know that voice.

1912
00:50:23.260 --> 00:50:23.840
Not mine.

1913
00:50:24.320 --> 00:50:27.320
So, emotional self-management comes

1914
00:50:27.320 --> 00:50:27.780
down to,

1915
00:50:27.900 --> 00:50:30.260
number one, understanding that emotions

1916
00:50:30.260 --> 00:50:31.260
that you have

1917
00:50:31.260 --> 00:50:33.600
are not just nice to have and

1918
00:50:33.600 --> 00:50:34.060
bad to have.

1919
00:50:34.540 --> 00:50:36.040
All they are are signals.

1920
00:50:36.160 --> 00:50:38.540
They're like the machine of your brain

1921
00:50:38.540 --> 00:50:40.060
perceives outside stimuli

1922
00:50:40.060 --> 00:50:43.520
and turns it into a universal language

1923
00:50:43.520 --> 00:50:47.300
that can send signals to the neocortex

1924
00:50:47.300 --> 00:50:47.920
of your brain,

1925
00:50:48.020 --> 00:50:50.940
the outside wrinkly area of your brain,

1926
00:50:51.020 --> 00:50:52.100
especially the prefrontal cortex,

1927
00:50:52.280 --> 00:50:54.140
which is the most modern part of

1928
00:50:54.140 --> 00:50:54.680
the human brain,

1929
00:50:54.900 --> 00:50:56.120
to send a signal so that you

1930
00:50:56.120 --> 00:50:56.520
can decide

1931
00:50:56.520 --> 00:50:57.740
how to react according to them.

1932
00:50:57.800 --> 00:50:58.920
And it doesn't matter what language

1933
00:50:58.920 --> 00:50:59.380
you speak

1934
00:50:59.380 --> 00:51:00.500
or where you grew up.

1935
00:51:00.600 --> 00:51:02.000
Everybody gets the same signals.

1936
00:51:02.420 --> 00:51:04.740
They get the basic emotions of joy,

1937
00:51:05.040 --> 00:51:06.300
of interest,

1938
00:51:06.380 --> 00:51:08.140
which are the two positive basic emotions.

1939
00:51:08.140 --> 00:51:09.240
The negative emotions,

1940
00:51:09.320 --> 00:51:10.400
which doesn't mean that they're bad,

1941
00:51:10.520 --> 00:51:11.940
just means that they're negative.

1942
00:51:12.520 --> 00:51:14.260
Anger, disgust, sadness, fear.

1943
00:51:14.720 --> 00:51:16.520
And all those things are then blended together

1944
00:51:16.520 --> 00:51:18.280
into these complex emotions.

1945
00:51:18.480 --> 00:51:20.160
So, anger and disgust, you blend them together,

1946
00:51:20.240 --> 00:51:21.120
you get contempt,

1947
00:51:21.540 --> 00:51:23.260
which is the conviction of the worthlessness

1948
00:51:23.260 --> 00:51:23.840
of something.

1949
00:51:23.940 --> 00:51:26.120
So, it's this multiplicity of emotions

1950
00:51:26.120 --> 00:51:26.660
that we get.

1951
00:51:26.720 --> 00:51:29.800
They exist to send signals, universal signals,

1952
00:51:29.800 --> 00:51:31.260
and then we get to decide how

1953
00:51:31.260 --> 00:51:31.620
to react.

1954
00:51:32.080 --> 00:51:32.720
Here's the problem.

1955
00:51:33.220 --> 00:51:35.260
Most people don't take that opportunity.

1956
00:51:36.100 --> 00:51:37.920
Most people take their emotions as given,

1957
00:51:37.920 --> 00:51:41.020
regret them, like them, and act according

1958
00:51:41.020 --> 00:51:41.400
to them

1959
00:51:41.400 --> 00:51:43.680
without doing that last trick,

1960
00:51:43.840 --> 00:51:45.580
that last entrepreneurial trick,

1961
00:51:45.660 --> 00:51:47.840
which is deciding how to react.

1962
00:51:47.960 --> 00:51:48.840
You get to decide.

1963
00:51:48.920 --> 00:51:50.120
This is Viktor Frankl's point.

1964
00:51:50.220 --> 00:51:52.540
The book is Man's Search for Meaning.

1965
00:51:53.140 --> 00:51:55.200
And what he learned in the concentration camp

1966
00:51:55.200 --> 00:51:56.980
was that all these bad things are happening

1967
00:51:57.500 --> 00:51:58.960
and good things happen in life.

1968
00:51:59.060 --> 00:52:00.680
You decide how you're going to react

1969
00:52:00.680 --> 00:52:01.160
to these things.

1970
00:52:01.260 --> 00:52:02.980
That's the ultimate entrepreneurial

1971
00:52:02.980 --> 00:52:05.020
task of human life

1972
00:52:05.020 --> 00:52:06.720
is deciding how you're going to use

1973
00:52:06.720 --> 00:52:07.360
the resources

1974
00:52:07.360 --> 00:52:08.480
under your control.

1975
00:52:08.940 --> 00:52:10.240
And the first set of resources you

1976
00:52:10.240 --> 00:52:10.940
get are your emotions.

1977
00:52:11.580 --> 00:52:14.420
Okay, so the time between the stimulus

1978
00:52:14.420 --> 00:52:15.040
and response,

1979
00:52:15.180 --> 00:52:17.180
the time between the emotions

1980
00:52:17.180 --> 00:52:18.900
and the reactions that you decide,

1981
00:52:19.500 --> 00:52:21.540
that's the gap that Viktor Frankl

1982
00:52:21.540 --> 00:52:22.280
is talking about.

1983
00:52:22.440 --> 00:52:23.740
You want that to be as wide

1984
00:52:23.740 --> 00:52:24.460
as possible.

1985
00:52:24.880 --> 00:52:26.100
That's why, and every time you have

1986
00:52:26.100 --> 00:52:26.500
an emotion,

1987
00:52:26.700 --> 00:52:27.800
the most important thing to do is

1988
00:52:27.800 --> 00:52:28.880
to not react,

1989
00:52:29.600 --> 00:52:32.000
is to practice not reacting when you

1990
00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:32.540
feel something,

1991
00:52:32.560 --> 00:52:33.000
good or bad.

1992
00:52:33.860 --> 00:52:34.180
Wait.

1993
00:52:34.180 --> 00:52:35.100
Tell me why.

1994
00:52:35.160 --> 00:52:37.020
Because this is where I see people

1995
00:52:37.020 --> 00:52:38.420
get lost all the time.

1996
00:52:38.540 --> 00:52:39.920
They trust their emotions.

1997
00:52:40.040 --> 00:52:41.360
They think their emotions are right.

1998
00:52:41.460 --> 00:52:43.700
They are a map of actual reality.

1999
00:52:43.900 --> 00:52:45.640
And that if you feel angry, you

2000
00:52:45.640 --> 00:52:46.280
should act angry.

2001
00:52:46.520 --> 00:52:49.040
And that's a great way to live

2002
00:52:49.040 --> 00:52:49.720
an unhappy life

2003
00:52:49.720 --> 00:52:51.060
and make other people unhappy around you.

2004
00:52:51.120 --> 00:52:52.660
I agree so violently.

2005
00:52:52.740 --> 00:52:53.720
I can't even tell you.

2006
00:52:53.720 --> 00:52:54.000
Yeah, yeah.

2007
00:52:54.020 --> 00:52:54.920
And think about all the times

2008
00:52:54.920 --> 00:52:55.940
when you're building your companies

2009
00:52:56.560 --> 00:52:58.560
that you felt something negative.

2010
00:52:58.740 --> 00:52:59.920
And if you just yelled it, you

2011
00:52:59.920 --> 00:53:01.080
snapped at somebody

2012
00:53:01.080 --> 00:53:02.500
or said that was on your mind,

2013
00:53:02.500 --> 00:53:05.060
you would have done catastrophic brain damage

2014
00:53:05.060 --> 00:53:05.560
to your company.

2015
00:53:05.800 --> 00:53:06.780
It would have been terrible.

2016
00:53:07.620 --> 00:53:09.160
Instead, or you get that email.

2017
00:53:09.780 --> 00:53:10.860
You know, you get an email and

2018
00:53:10.860 --> 00:53:11.220
it's like,

2019
00:53:11.360 --> 00:53:14.020
I want to answer right now.

2020
00:53:14.440 --> 00:53:14.800
Don't.

2021
00:53:15.320 --> 00:53:16.980
Never answer a bad email on the

2022
00:53:16.980 --> 00:53:17.580
day you get it.

2023
00:53:17.840 --> 00:53:18.080
Never.

2024
00:53:18.340 --> 00:53:19.320
Just have an automatic, as a matter

2025
00:53:19.320 --> 00:53:19.520
of fact,

2026
00:53:19.600 --> 00:53:20.860
have somebody who's managing your

2027
00:53:20.860 --> 00:53:21.420
email for you

2028
00:53:21.420 --> 00:53:22.320
so you don't see them.

2029
00:53:22.960 --> 00:53:24.580
You see them and you think about it,

2030
00:53:24.620 --> 00:53:25.440
but you can't answer it

2031
00:53:25.440 --> 00:53:26.920
because it disappears from your inbox

2032
00:53:26.920 --> 00:53:27.680
for 24 hours.

2033
00:53:27.760 --> 00:53:29.020
Make a deal with somebody.

2034
00:53:29.340 --> 00:53:29.500
Why?

2035
00:53:29.500 --> 00:53:33.040
Because you want your prefrontal cortex

2036
00:53:33.040 --> 00:53:33.920
to be in charge.

2037
00:53:34.180 --> 00:53:35.300
You don't want your limbic system

2038
00:53:35.300 --> 00:53:35.760
to be in charge.

2039
00:53:35.820 --> 00:53:36.700
It's a two-year-old.

2040
00:53:37.420 --> 00:53:38.920
You know, when kids, when you have

2041
00:53:38.920 --> 00:53:39.580
little kids

2042
00:53:39.580 --> 00:53:42.260
and, you know, I have grown kids,

2043
00:53:42.320 --> 00:53:44.880
but now I have grandchildren and they yell.

2044
00:53:45.560 --> 00:53:47.080
And what you tell little kids always

2045
00:53:47.080 --> 00:53:48.680
is use your words.

2046
00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:51.000
What you're telling them is put more time

2047
00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:52.800
between stimulus and response

2048
00:53:52.800 --> 00:53:54.520
and choose the response that you want.

2049
00:53:54.720 --> 00:53:55.400
You're not going to say that to

2050
00:53:55.400 --> 00:53:55.860
a little kid.

2051
00:53:56.180 --> 00:53:58.140
You're going to say something that's truncated,

2052
00:53:58.260 --> 00:53:59.040
like use your words.

2053
00:53:59.040 --> 00:54:00.480
And people who are reactive,

2054
00:54:00.700 --> 00:54:01.900
what we say as social scientists,

2055
00:54:02.020 --> 00:54:03.300
we call them limbic people

2056
00:54:03.820 --> 00:54:05.960
because they're acting according to

2057
00:54:05.960 --> 00:54:06.980
their limbic system.

2058
00:54:07.080 --> 00:54:09.020
This is the most unentrepreneurial

2059
00:54:09.020 --> 00:54:09.500
thing to do.

2060
00:54:09.900 --> 00:54:11.760
That's basically like, I got a dollar,

2061
00:54:11.900 --> 00:54:12.680
I spent a dollar.

2062
00:54:14.500 --> 00:54:16.260
Revenue comes in, you decide what

2063
00:54:16.260 --> 00:54:16.660
to do.

2064
00:54:17.180 --> 00:54:18.280
Should you invest it?

2065
00:54:18.500 --> 00:54:19.540
Should you distribute it?

2066
00:54:20.120 --> 00:54:21.440
Should you buy something with it?

2067
00:54:21.520 --> 00:54:22.100
What should you do?

2068
00:54:22.480 --> 00:54:23.880
That's what good entrepreneurs do

2069
00:54:23.880 --> 00:54:24.460
with their lives,

2070
00:54:24.560 --> 00:54:25.580
but that's how we need to see

2071
00:54:25.580 --> 00:54:25.940
our emotion.

2072
00:54:26.080 --> 00:54:27.380
So that's the most important point.

2073
00:54:27.380 --> 00:54:30.460
Now, what you do in that gap

2074
00:54:30.460 --> 00:54:31.880
is called metacognition.

2075
00:54:32.140 --> 00:54:33.340
And this is where it gets really,

2076
00:54:33.520 --> 00:54:33.920
really interesting.

2077
00:54:34.340 --> 00:54:36.340
In that gap, the best thing that

2078
00:54:36.340 --> 00:54:37.060
you can possibly do

2079
00:54:37.060 --> 00:54:38.780
is to think about the emotions that

2080
00:54:38.780 --> 00:54:39.300
you're feeling,

2081
00:54:39.520 --> 00:54:41.440
what they mean, and how best to

2082
00:54:41.440 --> 00:54:41.960
use them.

2083
00:54:42.300 --> 00:54:45.280
So that, and this is really the engagement

2084
00:54:45.280 --> 00:54:46.280
of your prefrontal cortex.

2085
00:54:46.420 --> 00:54:48.060
That's what meditation practices tell

2086
00:54:48.060 --> 00:54:48.440
you to do.

2087
00:54:48.840 --> 00:54:50.800
This is what prayer helps you to do.

2088
00:54:51.140 --> 00:54:53.100
This is what walking in nature helps

2089
00:54:53.100 --> 00:54:53.540
you to do.

2090
00:54:53.580 --> 00:54:55.760
So all these metacognitive practices,

2091
00:54:55.760 --> 00:54:57.820
this is what therapy is supposed to

2092
00:54:57.820 --> 00:54:58.940
do too, by the way.

2093
00:54:59.240 --> 00:55:01.060
It's supposed to give you expertise

2094
00:55:01.060 --> 00:55:02.980
in expanding that gap.

2095
00:55:04.060 --> 00:55:05.400
Then on top of that, there's all

2096
00:55:05.400 --> 00:55:07.200
of these ideas

2097
00:55:07.200 --> 00:55:07.960
that you can use.

2098
00:55:08.020 --> 00:55:09.700
Once you've got this time, you can

2099
00:55:09.700 --> 00:55:10.360
make these decisions.

2100
00:55:10.560 --> 00:55:12.060
You can substitute emotions.

2101
00:55:12.620 --> 00:55:13.960
You can say, that's not the right emotion.

2102
00:55:14.080 --> 00:55:14.900
Here's a better emotion.

2103
00:55:15.180 --> 00:55:16.500
You can literally do that.

2104
00:55:16.660 --> 00:55:17.740
How's that not just faking it?

2105
00:55:17.800 --> 00:55:18.900
It's not, it's what it's...

2106
00:55:18.900 --> 00:55:21.720
So for example, I've talked a lot

2107
00:55:21.720 --> 00:55:23.560
and I've been palling around lately

2108
00:55:23.560 --> 00:55:24.900
with, you know, Rainn Wilson, who's

2109
00:55:24.900 --> 00:55:25.440
the actor

2110
00:55:25.440 --> 00:55:25.820
from The Office.

2111
00:55:25.840 --> 00:55:26.280
Yeah, I've had him on the show.

2112
00:55:26.580 --> 00:55:27.060
He's terrific.

2113
00:55:27.880 --> 00:55:29.440
And we grew up, he grew up

2114
00:55:29.440 --> 00:55:29.840
in Ballard.

2115
00:55:30.100 --> 00:55:30.320
Yeah.

2116
00:55:30.460 --> 00:55:30.680
Yeah.

2117
00:55:30.720 --> 00:55:31.820
And so five miles away from me.

2118
00:55:31.820 --> 00:55:33.040
He's just the same age as me.

2119
00:55:33.180 --> 00:55:34.400
He was a classical musician, just

2120
00:55:34.400 --> 00:55:34.920
like I was.

2121
00:55:34.920 --> 00:55:37.040
I didn't know him, but we have parallel.

2122
00:55:37.060 --> 00:55:38.220
Wait, did he play like Bassoon or something?

2123
00:55:38.220 --> 00:55:38.780
He played the Bassoon.

2124
00:55:38.860 --> 00:55:39.300
I played the French horn.

2125
00:55:39.860 --> 00:55:41.600
We probably overlapped in Allstate Band

2126
00:55:41.600 --> 00:55:42.500
or something as we were kids,

2127
00:55:42.540 --> 00:55:44.520
but we have the same childhood basically.

2128
00:55:44.820 --> 00:55:45.600
And so it's interesting.

2129
00:55:45.740 --> 00:55:47.260
And so we really connect on this.

2130
00:55:47.360 --> 00:55:49.120
But for example, he talks about the

2131
00:55:49.120 --> 00:55:50.400
fact that most,

2132
00:55:51.060 --> 00:55:53.320
he believes that most comedians

2133
00:55:53.320 --> 00:55:54.580
suffer from depression.

2134
00:55:55.360 --> 00:55:56.840
And one of the reasons they're such

2135
00:55:56.840 --> 00:55:57.580
good comedians

2136
00:55:57.580 --> 00:56:00.000
is because they choose the substitute emotion

2137
00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:01.900
when they're feeling sadness of humor,

2138
00:56:02.100 --> 00:56:04.980
which is also an appropriate response

2139
00:56:04.980 --> 00:56:06.840
to things that are making you sad.

2140
00:56:07.040 --> 00:56:08.360
You make them into a joke

2141
00:56:08.360 --> 00:56:09.720
and people think of it as the

2142
00:56:09.720 --> 00:56:10.360
defense mechanism.

2143
00:56:10.500 --> 00:56:12.040
No, it's an emotional substitution.

2144
00:56:13.100 --> 00:56:15.260
It's the, when you drink coffee,

2145
00:56:15.420 --> 00:56:17.980
the caffeine molecule,

2146
00:56:17.980 --> 00:56:20.620
it looks just like the adenosine molecule,

2147
00:56:20.780 --> 00:56:23.320
which is a neuromodulator that is inhibitory.

2148
00:56:23.400 --> 00:56:24.380
It makes you feel tired.

2149
00:56:24.580 --> 00:56:25.720
It goes into the slot,

2150
00:56:25.880 --> 00:56:28.460
into the receptor for the adenosine.

2151
00:56:28.940 --> 00:56:30.040
And so you don't get adenosine.

2152
00:56:30.100 --> 00:56:31.140
That's what makes you feel peppy.

2153
00:56:31.660 --> 00:56:33.640
It blocks the thing that makes you

2154
00:56:33.640 --> 00:56:34.180
feel tired.

2155
00:56:34.300 --> 00:56:35.260
That's how caffeine works.

2156
00:56:35.720 --> 00:56:37.280
Emotional substitution works in the

2157
00:56:37.280 --> 00:56:37.760
same way.

2158
00:56:38.080 --> 00:56:41.280
The humor molecule goes into the sadness receptor,

2159
00:56:41.780 --> 00:56:43.380
but you can't do that unless you're

2160
00:56:43.380 --> 00:56:43.840
taking time.

2161
00:56:43.980 --> 00:56:46.080
You cannot do that unless you actually

2162
00:56:46.080 --> 00:56:47.020
expand the time

2163
00:56:47.020 --> 00:56:48.220
between stimulus and response

2164
00:56:48.220 --> 00:56:50.140
until you understand exactly how the

2165
00:56:50.140 --> 00:56:50.960
science works

2166
00:56:50.960 --> 00:56:52.720
and getting as much time as you

2167
00:56:52.720 --> 00:56:53.640
possibly can.

2168
00:56:53.900 --> 00:56:54.960
Was that the angle that you took

2169
00:56:54.960 --> 00:56:55.980
to understand the science

2170
00:56:55.980 --> 00:56:56.980
or did you come at it from

2171
00:56:56.980 --> 00:56:58.940
a God says

2172
00:56:58.940 --> 00:57:00.320
that this is the way to go

2173
00:57:00.320 --> 00:57:00.900
about life?

2174
00:57:00.960 --> 00:57:02.180
I'm a scientist, you know,

2175
00:57:02.200 --> 00:57:03.260
and one of the reasons that I

2176
00:57:03.260 --> 00:57:03.940
am religious

2177
00:57:03.940 --> 00:57:05.440
is because of my,

2178
00:57:06.040 --> 00:57:07.340
because what I've learned intellectually.

2179
00:57:07.920 --> 00:57:10.040
So for me, that was the thing

2180
00:57:10.040 --> 00:57:11.480
that freed me as well was,

2181
00:57:11.580 --> 00:57:13.740
so I'm call it 22.

2182
00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:15.900
I am very unhappy,

2183
00:57:15.900 --> 00:57:18.580
like really scary sliding towards

2184
00:57:18.580 --> 00:57:19.420
depression and happy.

2185
00:57:20.260 --> 00:57:22.380
And I started reading about the brain

2186
00:57:22.380 --> 00:57:23.840
and I don't remember what gave me

2187
00:57:23.840 --> 00:57:24.560
that impulse.

2188
00:57:24.760 --> 00:57:26.660
It was probably something I learned

2189
00:57:26.660 --> 00:57:27.100
in college

2190
00:57:27.100 --> 00:57:28.120
plus Taoism, whatever,

2191
00:57:28.140 --> 00:57:29.860
but it like really made me think

2192
00:57:29.860 --> 00:57:30.920
about the way the brain worked.

2193
00:57:31.380 --> 00:57:34.920
And I started reading about how brain plasticity

2194
00:57:34.920 --> 00:57:36.140
was this hotly debated thing.

2195
00:57:36.160 --> 00:57:37.680
And maybe you really could teach an

2196
00:57:37.680 --> 00:57:38.520
old dog new tricks.

2197
00:57:38.980 --> 00:57:40.060
And one day I just decided

2198
00:57:40.060 --> 00:57:42.280
I'm going to act as if brain

2199
00:57:42.280 --> 00:57:43.460
plasticity is real.

2200
00:57:43.660 --> 00:57:45.720
And then the more studies came out

2201
00:57:45.720 --> 00:57:47.140
that showed that it really was real.

2202
00:57:47.340 --> 00:57:48.400
Like the more I felt like I

2203
00:57:48.400 --> 00:57:49.240
could grab ahold of that,

2204
00:57:49.340 --> 00:57:53.760
but it was a science based insight

2205
00:57:53.760 --> 00:57:56.840
that allowed me to really change the tenor

2206
00:57:56.840 --> 00:57:57.840
of my entire life.

2207
00:57:58.180 --> 00:57:58.600
For sure.

2208
00:57:58.840 --> 00:57:59.180
For sure.

2209
00:57:59.280 --> 00:58:00.420
I mean, it's interesting

2210
00:58:00.420 --> 00:58:03.560
because people back when I was a kid,

2211
00:58:03.600 --> 00:58:04.720
I'm 10 years old,

2212
00:58:04.780 --> 00:58:05.800
a little over 10 years older than you.

2213
00:58:05.880 --> 00:58:06.440
And when I was a kid

2214
00:58:06.440 --> 00:58:08.780
or even when people were older than me

2215
00:58:09.320 --> 00:58:11.080
were coming through the whole idea

2216
00:58:11.080 --> 00:58:13.640
was that biology is just psychology.

2217
00:58:13.640 --> 00:58:16.200
You know, that you can think bad

2218
00:58:16.200 --> 00:58:16.980
things away.

2219
00:58:17.340 --> 00:58:18.340
And that was supposed to be really

2220
00:58:18.340 --> 00:58:19.180
incredibly empowering.

2221
00:58:19.360 --> 00:58:20.960
Now, really what we believe with the

2222
00:58:20.960 --> 00:58:21.620
advent of,

2223
00:58:21.720 --> 00:58:23.400
you know, the advances in neuroscience,

2224
00:58:23.840 --> 00:58:24.720
you know, as a social scientist,

2225
00:58:24.740 --> 00:58:26.220
I have to know tons of neuroscience.

2226
00:58:26.720 --> 00:58:28.920
Teaching happiness is 30% neuroscience.

2227
00:58:29.000 --> 00:58:30.360
What I teach, I'm talking about the

2228
00:58:30.360 --> 00:58:31.020
brain constantly.

2229
00:58:31.520 --> 00:58:33.660
It's much more the case.

2230
00:58:33.720 --> 00:58:36.000
We believe that psychology is actually biology.

2231
00:58:36.900 --> 00:58:39.100
And that sounds like it's not empowering.

2232
00:58:39.360 --> 00:58:40.440
Like this is all determined.

2233
00:58:40.980 --> 00:58:41.300
Wow, it's super empowering.

2234
00:58:41.340 --> 00:58:42.480
It's super empowering

2235
00:58:42.480 --> 00:58:43.660
because once you actually understand

2236
00:58:43.660 --> 00:58:44.160
the process,

2237
00:58:44.300 --> 00:58:45.240
you can intervene in the process.

2238
00:58:45.540 --> 00:58:47.600
I talked to young executives, for example,

2239
00:58:48.080 --> 00:58:49.440
and I say, one of the biggest

2240
00:58:49.440 --> 00:58:51.160
threats to your career

2241
00:58:51.160 --> 00:58:53.040
is an inappropriate sexual relationship

2242
00:58:53.040 --> 00:58:53.660
in the workplace.

2243
00:58:53.800 --> 00:58:55.100
Dude, that's so hilarious to me.

2244
00:58:55.360 --> 00:58:56.420
It's and so we say,

2245
00:58:56.520 --> 00:58:58.260
so let's understand how this is going

2246
00:58:58.260 --> 00:58:58.600
to work.

2247
00:58:58.660 --> 00:59:00.280
And you can psychologize it and say,

2248
00:59:00.360 --> 00:59:02.620
you know, you need to get some therapy.

2249
00:59:03.640 --> 00:59:05.360
What happens is the first thing

2250
00:59:05.360 --> 00:59:07.860
when you have attraction towards somebody

2251
00:59:07.860 --> 00:59:09.280
who's a potential romantic partner,

2252
00:59:09.840 --> 00:59:11.040
there's the first thing that happens

2253
00:59:11.040 --> 00:59:11.880
is sex hormones,

2254
00:59:11.880 --> 00:59:13.560
which testosterone and estrogen.

2255
00:59:14.240 --> 00:59:16.600
And in combination in both males and females,

2256
00:59:16.720 --> 00:59:17.240
this is happening.

2257
00:59:17.600 --> 00:59:18.860
The second thing that happens

2258
00:59:18.860 --> 00:59:20.460
in the neurochemical cascade of falling

2259
00:59:20.460 --> 00:59:20.820
in love

2260
00:59:20.820 --> 00:59:24.500
is there's an up and there's an increase

2261
00:59:24.500 --> 00:59:26.180
in norepinephrine and dopamine

2262
00:59:26.180 --> 00:59:27.520
so that you get the sense of

2263
00:59:27.520 --> 00:59:28.880
euphoria and anticipation.

2264
00:59:29.600 --> 00:59:31.260
The third thing that happens is a

2265
00:59:31.260 --> 00:59:32.380
drop in serotonin.

2266
00:59:32.840 --> 00:59:34.460
Now what happens when serotonin, a

2267
00:59:34.460 --> 00:59:35.540
drop in serotonin?

2268
00:59:35.680 --> 00:59:35.860
Interesting.

2269
00:59:36.180 --> 00:59:38.380
When serotonin drops, it makes you ruminate.

2270
00:59:38.680 --> 00:59:39.920
That's the reason it's associated

2271
00:59:39.920 --> 00:59:40.920
with clinical depression

2272
00:59:40.920 --> 00:59:42.580
because of the rumination procedure.

2273
00:59:42.780 --> 00:59:43.740
And so there's a part of the brain

2274
00:59:43.740 --> 00:59:45.300
called the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex,

2275
00:59:45.640 --> 00:59:47.880
which is incredibly active when you're ruminating.

2276
00:59:48.560 --> 00:59:49.960
It's one of the things when you're ruminating

2277
00:59:49.960 --> 00:59:51.720
on a business plan, on an opera,

2278
00:59:52.140 --> 00:59:53.040
on a poem,

2279
00:59:53.520 --> 00:59:55.320
on somebody who's rejected you.

2280
00:59:56.560 --> 00:59:59.260
So you see it incredibly active in depression

2281
00:59:59.260 --> 01:00:01.960
and creativity and falling in love

2282
01:00:01.960 --> 01:00:03.160
and all of these things that all

2283
01:00:03.160 --> 01:00:04.020
have rumination,

2284
01:00:04.300 --> 01:00:05.880
you know, iterative rumination involved

2285
01:00:05.880 --> 01:00:06.120
in it.

2286
01:00:06.180 --> 01:00:08.020
So it all is involved with a

2287
01:00:08.020 --> 01:00:08.740
drop in serotonin,

2288
01:00:08.820 --> 01:00:09.660
which is why you don't want to

2289
01:00:09.660 --> 01:00:10.460
have that early stages

2290
01:00:10.460 --> 01:00:11.260
of falling in love for the rest

2291
01:00:11.260 --> 01:00:11.660
of your life

2292
01:00:11.660 --> 01:00:13.540
because you'll want to die.

2293
01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:15.340
And then the last-

2294
01:00:15.340 --> 01:00:15.940
You'll want to die.

2295
01:00:16.320 --> 01:00:18.020
The early stages of love made me

2296
01:00:18.020 --> 01:00:18.420
feel like

2297
01:00:18.420 --> 01:00:19.600
I'd never get anything done again.

2298
01:00:19.620 --> 01:00:19.900
Yeah, yeah.

2299
01:00:19.960 --> 01:00:21.300
It makes you feel out of control.

2300
01:00:21.840 --> 01:00:23.800
Your brain looks suspiciously like

2301
01:00:23.800 --> 01:00:24.740
an MRI

2302
01:00:24.740 --> 01:00:26.980
in the brain of a methamphetamine addict.

2303
01:00:27.260 --> 01:00:27.400
Yeah, yeah.

2304
01:00:27.460 --> 01:00:28.160
That's how it felt.

2305
01:00:28.360 --> 01:00:31.000
I legitimately felt like I was on drugs.

2306
01:00:31.160 --> 01:00:32.660
And then you get the tide, the

2307
01:00:32.660 --> 01:00:33.140
warm tide

2308
01:00:33.140 --> 01:00:34.980
that comes in of the increases in oxytocin,

2309
01:00:35.080 --> 01:00:37.060
which is a bonding neuropeptide

2310
01:00:37.060 --> 01:00:38.360
that functions as a hormone in the brain.

2311
01:00:38.360 --> 01:00:39.240
Do you get that before it's reciprocated?

2312
01:00:39.740 --> 01:00:40.240
You-

2313
01:00:40.720 --> 01:00:42.320
Well, I mean, it happens when you

2314
01:00:42.320 --> 01:00:42.960
have eye contact

2315
01:00:42.960 --> 01:00:44.160
with somebody in a love connection,

2316
01:00:44.300 --> 01:00:45.680
eye contact, so you're both getting it.

2317
01:00:45.760 --> 01:00:47.520
The biggest bolus that you get of that

2318
01:00:47.520 --> 01:00:49.280
is when you first lay eyes on

2319
01:00:49.280 --> 01:00:50.340
eye contact

2320
01:00:50.340 --> 01:00:51.420
with your newborn baby.

2321
01:00:52.380 --> 01:00:52.740
Really?

2322
01:00:52.800 --> 01:00:54.840
Yeah, it's just like 4th of July

2323
01:00:54.840 --> 01:00:55.580
in your head.

2324
01:00:55.640 --> 01:00:57.340
But anyway, so it's one, two, three, four.

2325
01:00:57.400 --> 01:00:58.680
That's the neurochemical cascade.

2326
01:00:58.800 --> 01:00:59.840
The reason I bring this up

2327
01:00:59.840 --> 01:01:01.580
is when I'm talking to young people

2328
01:01:01.580 --> 01:01:02.060
in business,

2329
01:01:02.060 --> 01:01:04.440
I say, if you do not intervene

2330
01:01:04.440 --> 01:01:05.360
early enough

2331
01:01:05.360 --> 01:01:07.220
in this neurochemical cascade,

2332
01:01:08.080 --> 01:01:08.820
you're going to be in trouble

2333
01:01:08.820 --> 01:01:09.860
because it'll be out of control.

2334
01:01:10.020 --> 01:01:11.580
It'll be like, you know, no brakes

2335
01:01:11.580 --> 01:01:12.660
on the roller coaster.

2336
01:01:13.960 --> 01:01:17.240
And it's like, I have this incredible career

2337
01:01:17.240 --> 01:01:18.100
and this incredible job.

2338
01:01:18.180 --> 01:01:18.920
I don't know what happened.

2339
01:01:19.140 --> 01:01:20.700
We slept together and now I'm fired.

2340
01:01:20.940 --> 01:01:21.900
And you see it all the time.

2341
01:01:22.180 --> 01:01:24.060
Like Harvard Business School case study.

2342
01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:25.780
What happened?

2343
01:01:25.860 --> 01:01:27.580
Well, they let the neurochemical cascade

2344
01:01:27.580 --> 01:01:28.740
go too long

2345
01:01:28.740 --> 01:01:29.660
and you have to intervene.

2346
01:01:29.820 --> 01:01:31.100
Number one, don't put yourself in

2347
01:01:31.100 --> 01:01:31.480
a position

2348
01:01:31.480 --> 01:01:32.540
where you go to step two.

2349
01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:34.180
Don't put yourself in a position

2350
01:01:34.180 --> 01:01:34.900
where you go to step three.

2351
01:01:34.980 --> 01:01:35.440
What are you doing?

2352
01:01:35.720 --> 01:01:37.520
You're managing your brain.

2353
01:01:37.520 --> 01:01:39.800
And if you don't know the brain science,

2354
01:01:39.800 --> 01:01:40.860
you can't do that.

2355
01:01:40.940 --> 01:01:42.720
That's why this stuff is so incredibly empowering.

2356
01:01:42.800 --> 01:01:43.760
And when you read that stuff for

2357
01:01:43.760 --> 01:01:44.220
the first time,

2358
01:01:44.260 --> 01:01:46.900
you're like, oh, there's something

2359
01:01:46.900 --> 01:01:47.720
I can do here.

2360
01:01:47.860 --> 01:01:49.100
Now there's something I can use.

2361
01:01:49.160 --> 01:01:50.800
It's not just psychology.

2362
01:01:51.420 --> 01:01:53.280
Now it's something that's more tangible

2363
01:01:53.280 --> 01:01:53.760
than that

2364
01:01:53.760 --> 01:01:56.460
because the grandeur of this entire experience

2365
01:01:56.460 --> 01:01:57.660
has a biological basis

2366
01:01:57.660 --> 01:01:58.880
and one that I can understand

2367
01:01:58.880 --> 01:02:00.780
and one I can actually manage.

2368
01:02:01.420 --> 01:02:01.580
Yeah.

2369
01:02:01.660 --> 01:02:04.520
For me being able to picture the thing,

2370
01:02:05.440 --> 01:02:07.120
that helps a lot.

2371
01:02:07.120 --> 01:02:07.600
Yeah.

2372
01:02:07.780 --> 01:02:11.200
Once I could understand the myelination process,

2373
01:02:11.200 --> 01:02:12.140
I was like, oh, okay.

2374
01:02:12.140 --> 01:02:13.400
Now I get why this is something

2375
01:02:13.400 --> 01:02:14.260
I need to repeat.

2376
01:02:14.600 --> 01:02:17.360
Once I understood that the brain is

2377
01:02:17.360 --> 01:02:18.440
a caloric hog

2378
01:02:18.440 --> 01:02:20.160
and from an evolutionary standpoint,

2379
01:02:20.160 --> 01:02:22.080
that means anything that you do repeatedly,

2380
01:02:22.080 --> 01:02:23.460
it's going to hardwire just to make

2381
01:02:23.460 --> 01:02:24.220
it more efficient.

2382
01:02:24.920 --> 01:02:26.780
And so all of that coming together

2383
01:02:26.780 --> 01:02:29.160
really allowed me to begin to-

2384
01:02:29.160 --> 01:02:30.080
Improve your habits.

2385
01:02:30.340 --> 01:02:32.040
Because your habits, what they were doing

2386
01:02:32.040 --> 01:02:34.180
was improving the management of the organ.

2387
01:02:34.800 --> 01:02:36.600
And that was affecting your psychology

2388
01:02:36.600 --> 01:02:38.300
and your effectiveness and your happiness

2389
01:02:38.300 --> 01:02:41.480
and the whole progress that you're

2390
01:02:41.480 --> 01:02:42.340
making in your life.

2391
01:02:42.680 --> 01:02:45.440
That's why the information is so critically important.

2392
01:02:45.920 --> 01:02:48.120
That's why it can be so life-changing

2393
01:02:48.120 --> 01:02:51.040
to learn science actually.

2394
01:02:51.540 --> 01:02:51.820
For sure.

2395
01:02:52.180 --> 01:02:55.180
So what are then the habits of happiness

2396
01:02:55.180 --> 01:02:56.340
or maybe a better way,

2397
01:02:56.380 --> 01:02:57.280
this is a language you use in

2398
01:02:57.280 --> 01:02:57.540
the book,

2399
01:02:57.640 --> 01:03:00.320
the macronutrients of happiness.

2400
01:03:00.560 --> 01:03:01.800
Like what are those things

2401
01:03:01.800 --> 01:03:04.440
that we want to begin building our

2402
01:03:04.440 --> 01:03:04.940
lives around

2403
01:03:04.940 --> 01:03:06.040
if we really want to thrive?

2404
01:03:06.040 --> 01:03:09.140
So people define happiness in a lot

2405
01:03:09.140 --> 01:03:09.860
of different ways,

2406
01:03:10.140 --> 01:03:11.880
but the biggest mistake that people make

2407
01:03:11.880 --> 01:03:13.380
is thinking that it's a feeling,

2408
01:03:13.600 --> 01:03:15.040
that happiness is a feeling.

2409
01:03:16.440 --> 01:03:17.560
It's not a feeling.

2410
01:03:18.240 --> 01:03:18.720
Isn't it?

2411
01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:20.700
No, happiness has feelings associated

2412
01:03:20.700 --> 01:03:21.140
with it.

2413
01:03:21.280 --> 01:03:21.520
Okay.

2414
01:03:21.640 --> 01:03:23.420
But to say that my Thanksgiving turkey

2415
01:03:23.420 --> 01:03:24.640
has a smell

2416
01:03:24.640 --> 01:03:26.240
is different than saying that the

2417
01:03:26.240 --> 01:03:26.940
smell of the turkey

2418
01:03:26.940 --> 01:03:28.060
is the Thanksgiving dinner.

2419
01:03:28.060 --> 01:03:28.420
Right.

2420
01:03:28.560 --> 01:03:30.820
So that's a really big distinction

2421
01:03:30.820 --> 01:03:31.900
that it's important to make.

2422
01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:33.260
So your Thanksgiving dinner

2423
01:03:33.260 --> 01:03:34.960
is protein, carbohydrates and fat.

2424
01:03:34.960 --> 01:03:36.260
That's literally what your Thanksgiving

2425
01:03:36.260 --> 01:03:36.700
dinner is.

2426
01:03:36.760 --> 01:03:38.000
It also has a delicious smell

2427
01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:39.680
that attracts you to it and that

2428
01:03:39.680 --> 01:03:40.260
you want.

2429
01:03:40.620 --> 01:03:42.180
And if it didn't have that or

2430
01:03:42.180 --> 01:03:43.160
had the wrong smell,

2431
01:03:43.260 --> 01:03:45.420
it smelled like you're microwaving trash

2432
01:03:45.420 --> 01:03:46.980
when you walked into mom's house for Thanksgiving,

2433
01:03:47.120 --> 01:03:48.720
you'd be like, something's wrong here.

2434
01:03:49.200 --> 01:03:51.020
So, but getting past the feelings

2435
01:03:51.020 --> 01:03:51.560
on happiness

2436
01:03:51.560 --> 01:03:52.720
is what will set you free

2437
01:03:52.720 --> 01:03:54.080
to be able to manage it appropriately.

2438
01:03:55.580 --> 01:03:57.160

2449
01:04:21.080 --> 01:04:22.320
What I want to understand

2450
01:04:22.320 --> 01:04:24.000
when you started the think tank and

2451
01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:24.480
when you stopped,

2452
01:04:24.580 --> 01:04:26.540
obviously because we did the other interview

2453
01:04:26.540 --> 01:04:27.360
and I know your other book,

2454
01:04:27.460 --> 01:04:28.200
From Strength to Strength,

2455
01:04:28.220 --> 01:04:29.480
and I know the two big movements

2456
01:04:29.480 --> 01:04:30.180
in somebody's life

2457
01:04:30.180 --> 01:04:31.560
where you go from fluid intelligence

2458
01:04:31.560 --> 01:04:32.580
to crystalline intelligence,

2459
01:04:32.580 --> 01:04:33.560
where you're really bringing wisdom

2460
01:04:33.560 --> 01:04:34.020
to the table,

2461
01:04:34.080 --> 01:04:35.460
and that was your transitional moment

2462
01:04:35.460 --> 01:04:36.540
between those two.

2463
01:04:36.640 --> 01:04:38.120
So I understand all of that.

2464
01:04:38.180 --> 01:04:40.260
But at the same time, I do

2465
01:04:40.260 --> 01:04:41.320
wonder if

2466
01:04:42.600 --> 01:04:44.680
there were just other things caught

2467
01:04:44.680 --> 01:04:45.260
up in it

2468
01:04:45.260 --> 01:04:48.620
and that maybe the either,

2469
01:04:49.560 --> 01:04:51.120
I've heard you say you were no

2470
01:04:51.120 --> 01:04:52.000
longer making progress

2471
01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:53.200
when you were a French horn player,

2472
01:04:53.460 --> 01:04:54.480
and that's what made you want to

2473
01:04:54.480 --> 01:04:54.800
leave that.

2474
01:04:54.880 --> 01:04:55.880
I'm wondering if you felt like

2475
01:04:55.880 --> 01:04:57.380
you were no longer making progress

2476
01:04:57.380 --> 01:04:58.780
in the think tank,

2477
01:04:58.820 --> 01:05:00.120
and that's why you wanted to leave that.

2478
01:05:00.120 --> 01:05:03.660
Is that the moment where we all go,

2479
01:05:03.840 --> 01:05:06.140
oh, that's my cue now to find

2480
01:05:06.140 --> 01:05:07.420
that next assignment?

2481
01:05:07.960 --> 01:05:09.760
That's what we should use as a cue,

2482
01:05:10.100 --> 01:05:13.080
the natural cadence of the value that

2483
01:05:13.080 --> 01:05:13.660
you're creating.

2484
01:05:14.460 --> 01:05:16.260
Very, very few people get to create

2485
01:05:16.260 --> 01:05:17.420
more and more and more value

2486
01:05:17.420 --> 01:05:19.200
in one exact thing over the course

2487
01:05:19.200 --> 01:05:19.740
of their lives.

2488
01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.680
And we have an economy that accommodates change.

2489
01:05:22.900 --> 01:05:24.860
So it's really incumbent upon us

2490
01:05:24.860 --> 01:05:26.040
to have our antennae up and pay

2491
01:05:26.040 --> 01:05:26.720
attention to that

2492
01:05:26.720 --> 01:05:28.040
because we want to be able to

2493
01:05:28.040 --> 01:05:28.700
create that value

2494
01:05:28.700 --> 01:05:29.920
and be open to the next assignment.

2495
01:05:30.380 --> 01:05:32.060
So yeah, I mean, my motives are

2496
01:05:32.060 --> 01:05:32.620
never pure

2497
01:05:33.160 --> 01:05:34.580
because I'm just a guy.

2498
01:05:35.760 --> 01:05:37.820
But I do have a process of discernment.

2499
01:05:37.920 --> 01:05:39.620
Every philosophical and religious tradition

2500
01:05:39.620 --> 01:05:40.820
has a process of discernment.

2501
01:05:40.900 --> 01:05:42.160
Discernment is when you don't know

2502
01:05:42.160 --> 01:05:44.300
what to do, how you figure it out.

2503
01:05:44.940 --> 01:05:46.840
This is hard, the decision-making process.

2504
01:05:47.020 --> 01:05:47.920
And so I'll have students who are like,

2505
01:05:48.260 --> 01:05:49.420
I don't know, should I do a startup

2506
01:05:49.420 --> 01:05:50.780
or go work in investment banking?

2507
01:05:51.240 --> 01:05:53.960
Or should I marry this person or not?

2508
01:05:54.200 --> 01:05:55.960
Or should I go to law school

2509
01:05:55.960 --> 01:05:57.340
or stay at work?

2510
01:05:57.340 --> 01:06:00.260
Or some things are even more personal

2511
01:06:00.260 --> 01:06:02.120
and delicate and difficult.

2512
01:06:02.380 --> 01:06:03.800
But at any particular time,

2513
01:06:03.860 --> 01:06:04.820
a third of the people who are

2514
01:06:04.820 --> 01:06:05.640
watching us

2515
01:06:05.640 --> 01:06:08.240
are agonizing over a particular decision.

2516
01:06:08.680 --> 01:06:09.400
So the question is,

2517
01:06:09.480 --> 01:06:11.000
how do you make these difficult decisions?

2518
01:06:11.080 --> 01:06:12.380
And every philosophical tradition

2519
01:06:12.380 --> 01:06:13.220
has a process

2520
01:06:13.220 --> 01:06:14.300
on how to make a decision.

2521
01:06:14.600 --> 01:06:16.060
And here's the key thing that they

2522
01:06:16.060 --> 01:06:16.660
all have in common.

2523
01:06:16.960 --> 01:06:18.180
You got to do the work.

2524
01:06:18.760 --> 01:06:19.960
And to do the work means you

2525
01:06:19.960 --> 01:06:21.360
need to think about it.

2526
01:06:21.660 --> 01:06:22.800
It doesn't mean you need to think

2527
01:06:22.800 --> 01:06:23.720
about a particular thing.

2528
01:06:23.740 --> 01:06:26.680
You need to think about that decision process

2529
01:06:26.680 --> 01:06:27.700
every day.

2530
01:06:28.480 --> 01:06:29.420
What are you thinking about?

2531
01:06:29.540 --> 01:06:32.040
So when I have students that haven't

2532
01:06:32.040 --> 01:06:33.100
even begun this process,

2533
01:06:33.240 --> 01:06:34.980
I'll say, okay, 15 minutes a day,

2534
01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:36.960
I want you to start by sitting

2535
01:06:36.960 --> 01:06:38.220
alone at your desk,

2536
01:06:38.380 --> 01:06:40.800
no music, no phone is not there.

2537
01:06:41.420 --> 01:06:43.300
Write lists of things you like.

2538
01:06:44.180 --> 01:06:46.000
You got to start getting in touch

2539
01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:47.660
with the things that are attractive

2540
01:06:47.660 --> 01:06:48.180
to you.

2541
01:06:48.180 --> 01:06:49.360
Because some people are completely

2542
01:06:49.360 --> 01:06:50.740
even divorced from that.

2543
01:06:50.800 --> 01:06:52.440
They have no, they're so far away

2544
01:06:52.440 --> 01:06:53.640
from being able to discern what they

2545
01:06:53.640 --> 01:06:54.280
want to do

2546
01:06:54.280 --> 01:06:56.040
that they don't even know what they like.

2547
01:06:56.040 --> 01:06:57.320
And so just starting to write places

2548
01:06:57.320 --> 01:06:57.800
I've gone

2549
01:06:57.800 --> 01:06:58.760
that I really enjoyed,

2550
01:06:59.020 --> 01:07:00.060
not because you're deciding where

2551
01:07:00.060 --> 01:07:00.540
to go next,

2552
01:07:00.560 --> 01:07:01.460
but just because you're trying to

2553
01:07:01.460 --> 01:07:01.860
get that

2554
01:07:01.860 --> 01:07:03.080
in order in your head.

2555
01:07:03.200 --> 01:07:05.040
What are the things that are attractive

2556
01:07:05.040 --> 01:07:05.440
to me?

2557
01:07:05.500 --> 01:07:06.900
What are the things that I actually like?

2558
01:07:07.560 --> 01:07:09.940
I'll tell people that they should,

2559
01:07:10.160 --> 01:07:12.080
to be thinking about just a process

2560
01:07:12.080 --> 01:07:14.600
to let the discernment happen.

2561
01:07:14.720 --> 01:07:16.480
You have to be very quiet and

2562
01:07:16.480 --> 01:07:17.460
very concerted

2563
01:07:17.460 --> 01:07:18.440
in the effort to do so.

2564
01:07:18.480 --> 01:07:20.220
To walk for an hour before dawn,

2565
01:07:20.620 --> 01:07:21.560
every day with no devices.

2566
01:07:22.280 --> 01:07:22.880
And to do that.

2567
01:07:22.980 --> 01:07:24.320
So people who are really religious,

2568
01:07:24.320 --> 01:07:27.140
I'll say 15 minutes a day praying

2569
01:07:27.140 --> 01:07:27.960
about this

2570
01:07:27.960 --> 01:07:30.400
to be given the discernment,

2571
01:07:30.800 --> 01:07:32.160
to be given proper discernment,

2572
01:07:32.260 --> 01:07:33.520
15 minutes a day on your knees.

2573
01:07:34.220 --> 01:07:36.100
So, and, or meditation practice.

2574
01:07:36.260 --> 01:07:37.020
There's lots of ways to do this.

2575
01:07:37.020 --> 01:07:37.940
What's the difference between prayer

2576
01:07:37.940 --> 01:07:38.420
and meditation?

2577
01:07:38.700 --> 01:07:39.540
Is there one?

2578
01:07:39.800 --> 01:07:41.060
Well, there's lots of forms of prayer

2579
01:07:41.060 --> 01:07:42.040
and lots of forms of meditation.

2580
01:07:42.400 --> 01:07:44.660
So there are a lot of meditation techniques,

2581
01:07:44.800 --> 01:07:47.140
single point meditation, analytical meditation,

2582
01:07:48.360 --> 01:07:49.740
meditation of compassion,

2583
01:07:49.900 --> 01:07:53.800
all different sort of Theravada, Mahayana traditions.

2584
01:07:53.800 --> 01:07:56.000
Are you trying to make your best

2585
01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:57.020
case to God?

2586
01:07:57.080 --> 01:07:59.400
Or are you just repeating an idea

2587
01:07:59.400 --> 01:07:59.860
in your head?

2588
01:07:59.940 --> 01:08:01.320
Like, please grant me the discernment

2589
01:08:01.320 --> 01:08:02.440
to understand what I should do in

2590
01:08:02.440 --> 01:08:02.900
this moment.

2591
01:08:03.040 --> 01:08:04.100
So there are different ways to do it.

2592
01:08:04.120 --> 01:08:05.140
There are different forms of prayer,

2593
01:08:05.220 --> 01:08:06.940
even Christian prayer, even Catholic prayer,

2594
01:08:06.980 --> 01:08:08.020
which is what I engage in.

2595
01:08:08.060 --> 01:08:09.700
So every night I pray 25 minutes,

2596
01:08:09.800 --> 01:08:10.560
which is called the Rosary,

2597
01:08:10.660 --> 01:08:12.020
a thousand-year-old meditative prayer

2598
01:08:12.020 --> 01:08:13.200
before I go to sleep every night.

2599
01:08:13.300 --> 01:08:14.360
And that's a thing you repeat.

2600
01:08:14.780 --> 01:08:15.800
And it's a thing that you repeat

2601
01:08:15.800 --> 01:08:18.180
while you're meditating on particular mysteries

2602
01:08:18.180 --> 01:08:19.820
that happened in biblical tradition.

2603
01:08:20.380 --> 01:08:21.180
And what are you doing?

2604
01:08:21.240 --> 01:08:21.980
You're focusing,

2605
01:08:21.980 --> 01:08:24.660
you're seeing your life through the lens

2606
01:08:24.660 --> 01:08:26.440
of these great stories.

2607
01:08:27.060 --> 01:08:27.920
And what that does is helps you

2608
01:08:27.920 --> 01:08:28.880
understand yourself better

2609
01:08:28.880 --> 01:08:30.280
in all kinds of insight.

2610
01:08:30.520 --> 01:08:32.420
Insight comes to you over the context

2611
01:08:32.420 --> 01:08:33.120
of this process.

2612
01:08:33.220 --> 01:08:34.340
That's a kind of a centering prayer.

2613
01:08:34.860 --> 01:08:36.380
There are other prayers that are called

2614
01:08:36.380 --> 01:08:37.880
mental prayer,

2615
01:08:38.080 --> 01:08:40.200
which the Buddhists call analytical meditation.

2616
01:08:40.460 --> 01:08:41.980
The Dalai Lama wakes up every morning

2617
01:08:42.500 --> 01:08:44.760
and the first two hours are analytical meditation

2618
01:08:44.760 --> 01:08:46.360
where he'll just think deeply

2619
01:08:46.360 --> 01:08:48.720
about a passage in Tibetan Buddhist scripture.

2620
01:08:49.100 --> 01:08:50.080
He's thinking about it.

2621
01:08:50.080 --> 01:08:50.920
He's not reading it.

2622
01:08:50.920 --> 01:08:52.580
He's written down a few lines

2623
01:08:52.580 --> 01:08:54.460
and he's looking at it and thinking

2624
01:08:54.460 --> 01:08:54.780
about it

2625
01:08:54.780 --> 01:08:55.180
for two hours.

2626
01:08:55.260 --> 01:08:56.800
He gets 88 and he's doing that

2627
01:08:56.800 --> 01:08:58.080
for the first two hours of every day.

2628
01:08:58.140 --> 01:08:59.220
That's analytical meditation.

2629
01:08:59.500 --> 01:09:01.140
That's not just like looking at a flame

2630
01:09:01.140 --> 01:09:02.640
or doing soul cycle or something.

2631
01:09:02.780 --> 01:09:05.640
That's not, he's, and that's also meditation,

2632
01:09:05.920 --> 01:09:06.880
incredibly important.

2633
01:09:07.040 --> 01:09:08.480
Mental prayer is the same thing

2634
01:09:08.480 --> 01:09:10.160
where you'll read a passage of scripture,

2635
01:09:10.660 --> 01:09:12.880
whether your scripture is the suttas

2636
01:09:12.880 --> 01:09:15.080
or the New Testament or whatever your

2637
01:09:15.080 --> 01:09:15.720
thing is.

2638
01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:16.980
And you read it and you say,

2639
01:09:17.500 --> 01:09:19.120
and you say, what is this meaning

2640
01:09:19.120 --> 01:09:19.620
to me?

2641
01:09:19.620 --> 01:09:21.480
Where am I in this?

2642
01:09:21.540 --> 01:09:23.300
How is this impacting my life?

2643
01:09:23.400 --> 01:09:25.940
Two sentences, 15 minutes, more.

2644
01:09:26.080 --> 01:09:27.600
It's crazy how much insight

2645
01:09:27.600 --> 01:09:28.720
you can actually get from that.

2646
01:09:29.100 --> 01:09:30.620
There's compassionate meditation

2647
01:09:30.620 --> 01:09:31.880
or compassionate prayer

2648
01:09:31.880 --> 01:09:33.960
where you bring into your mind

2649
01:09:33.960 --> 01:09:36.300
the people that are giving you struggle

2650
01:09:36.800 --> 01:09:37.740
and you think about,

2651
01:09:37.880 --> 01:09:39.600
you visualize good things happening

2652
01:09:39.600 --> 01:09:39.940
to them

2653
01:09:39.940 --> 01:09:41.540
and you ask God or you ask

2654
01:09:41.540 --> 01:09:42.260
the cosmos

2655
01:09:42.260 --> 01:09:43.420
that good things,

2656
01:09:43.600 --> 01:09:45.720
that blessings be rain down upon them

2657
01:09:45.720 --> 01:09:47.100
and you change the nature

2658
01:09:47.100 --> 01:09:49.160
of your orientation toward them.

2659
01:09:49.620 --> 01:09:51.440
The biggest reason that you have enmity

2660
01:09:51.440 --> 01:09:52.160
with other people

2661
01:09:52.160 --> 01:09:54.120
is because of your enmity toward them,

2662
01:09:54.240 --> 01:09:55.660
not theirs toward you, typically.

2663
01:09:56.080 --> 01:09:57.820
And you can literally change that

2664
01:09:57.820 --> 01:09:58.820
and this is one of the techniques

2665
01:09:58.820 --> 01:09:59.540
for doing so.

2666
01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:01.620
So different kinds of prayer and meditation,

2667
01:10:01.860 --> 01:10:03.000
they have different functions,

2668
01:10:03.100 --> 01:10:04.600
but we have to use them as such

2669
01:10:04.600 --> 01:10:05.560
and not just be kind of like,

2670
01:10:05.620 --> 01:10:07.820
all right, like a little kid,

2671
01:10:08.100 --> 01:10:10.460
like God, I sure hope I get

2672
01:10:10.460 --> 01:10:11.400
an A on that exam.

2673
01:10:11.500 --> 01:10:12.420
Can you please help me get an

2674
01:10:12.420 --> 01:10:13.020
A on that exam?

2675
01:10:13.080 --> 01:10:14.700
You have to be a grownup about

2676
01:10:14.700 --> 01:10:15.320
this stuff

2677
01:10:15.320 --> 01:10:17.160
and it's super exciting.

2678
01:10:17.300 --> 01:10:19.300
And it, so that's the process of discernment

2679
01:10:19.300 --> 01:10:20.460
when you're trying to figure out what

2680
01:10:20.460 --> 01:10:20.720
to do

2681
01:10:20.720 --> 01:10:22.540
is you have to concentrate on it.

2682
01:10:23.080 --> 01:10:24.920
The ancient Greeks called it sunesis.

2683
01:10:25.920 --> 01:10:28.460
In the Pali Buddhist tradition,

2684
01:10:28.660 --> 01:10:29.840
in the Mahayana Buddhist tradition,

2685
01:10:29.920 --> 01:10:31.100
it's called panna.

2686
01:10:31.940 --> 01:10:34.160
And in this discernment of spirits

2687
01:10:34.160 --> 01:10:35.760
in Ignatian Catholic spirituality,

2688
01:10:36.100 --> 01:10:37.380
every tradition has it

2689
01:10:37.380 --> 01:10:38.560
where you're focused on it,

2690
01:10:38.640 --> 01:10:39.960
focused on it, focused on it

2691
01:10:39.960 --> 01:10:41.020
for a particular period of time.

2692
01:10:41.200 --> 01:10:42.660
If you do the work

2693
01:10:42.660 --> 01:10:44.340
where you're focused on the decision,

2694
01:10:44.560 --> 01:10:47.220
looking for the insight for 15 minutes

2695
01:10:47.220 --> 01:10:47.540
a day

2696
01:10:47.540 --> 01:10:50.140
for two months, you'll have clarity.

2697
01:10:50.440 --> 01:10:51.280
That's the guarantee.

2698
01:10:51.540 --> 01:10:52.240
It's amazing.

2699
01:10:52.560 --> 01:10:54.160
But the reason that people can't get clarity

2700
01:10:54.160 --> 01:10:55.260
is because they don't do the work.

2701
01:10:55.580 --> 01:10:56.660
They don't do the analysis.

2702
01:10:57.640 --> 01:10:58.680
Yeah, for sure.

2703
01:11:00.100 --> 01:11:01.860
Okay, walk me through the idols.

2704
01:11:02.200 --> 01:11:03.300
What are the idols

2705
01:11:03.300 --> 01:11:04.820
and how do we use them well

2706
01:11:04.820 --> 01:11:06.120
instead of being used by them?

2707
01:11:06.480 --> 01:11:07.960
So this is a tradition

2708
01:11:07.960 --> 01:11:10.640
that comes from Neoplatonism,

2709
01:11:10.640 --> 01:11:11.540
sort of from Plato

2710
01:11:11.540 --> 01:11:14.600
as best stated by his great pupil, Aristotle,

2711
01:11:14.600 --> 01:11:16.480
and then translated

2712
01:11:16.480 --> 01:11:18.380
into the Islamic Jewish

2713
01:11:18.380 --> 01:11:19.400
and Christian traditions

2714
01:11:19.400 --> 01:11:20.200
in the Middle Ages.

2715
01:11:20.680 --> 01:11:22.980
So Averroes, who is the, you know,

2716
01:11:23.020 --> 01:11:24.600
the Muslim philosopher

2717
01:11:24.600 --> 01:11:26.300
for me from southern Spain,

2718
01:11:28.980 --> 01:11:30.700
Moshe ben Mammonides

2719
01:11:31.200 --> 01:11:32.420
and Thomas Aquinas.

2720
01:11:32.880 --> 01:11:33.720
So these are the, you know,

2721
01:11:33.760 --> 01:11:34.280
St. Thomas Aquinas,

2722
01:11:34.360 --> 01:11:35.720
these are the great figures of this.

2723
01:11:35.780 --> 01:11:38.500
And they really, they translated Aristotle

2724
01:11:38.500 --> 01:11:40.880
into saying that Aristotle

2725
01:11:40.880 --> 01:11:41.400
was the greatest

2726
01:11:41.400 --> 01:11:42.560
of all the social scientists.

2727
01:11:42.560 --> 01:11:44.400
I mean, I realize

2728
01:11:44.400 --> 01:11:45.360
I'm cheapening Aristotle

2729
01:11:45.360 --> 01:11:46.340
in this way by saying it,

2730
01:11:46.520 --> 01:11:48.560
but it's kind of a conceit

2731
01:11:48.560 --> 01:11:49.660
that everybody you love is like,

2732
01:11:49.720 --> 01:11:51.000
Tom, you're a great social scientist.

2733
01:11:51.080 --> 01:11:52.460
That's like the ultimate compliment

2734
01:11:52.460 --> 01:11:53.420
from a social scientist.

2735
01:11:53.720 --> 01:11:54.440
So by the way,

2736
01:11:54.460 --> 01:11:55.460
you're a very good social scientist.

2737
01:11:56.080 --> 01:11:58.700
So for example,

2738
01:11:58.820 --> 01:11:59.880
Aquinas said that there's

2739
01:12:00.700 --> 01:12:02.260
four substitutes for God,

2740
01:12:03.140 --> 01:12:04.300
that he believed,

2741
01:12:04.420 --> 01:12:07.360
as did Averroes and Mammonides

2742
01:12:07.360 --> 01:12:09.980
and all of the monotheistic

2743
01:12:09.980 --> 01:12:10.660
religious leaders,

2744
01:12:10.660 --> 01:12:12.680
that what we ultimately want is God.

2745
01:12:12.960 --> 01:12:14.460
Now, atheists watching us

2746
01:12:14.460 --> 01:12:15.620
or agnostics disagree with that,

2747
01:12:15.680 --> 01:12:17.240
but we all want something.

2748
01:12:17.680 --> 01:12:18.900
Can you define what that means then?

2749
01:12:19.080 --> 01:12:20.480
To define, to want God?

2750
01:12:20.660 --> 01:12:23.080
Yeah, because I have a feeling

2751
01:12:23.080 --> 01:12:24.920
even atheists want a thing

2752
01:12:24.920 --> 01:12:26.320
to fit that God-shaped hole,

2753
01:12:26.540 --> 01:12:28.100
but I've never taken the time

2754
01:12:28.100 --> 01:12:29.340
for myself to define

2755
01:12:29.340 --> 01:12:30.560
what the God-shaped hole is.

2756
01:12:31.180 --> 01:12:31.780
So I'd love to know.

2757
01:12:31.900 --> 01:12:32.780
Yeah, so this is the thing,

2758
01:12:32.880 --> 01:12:33.340
for example,

2759
01:12:34.480 --> 01:12:35.800
you're looking for something

2760
01:12:35.800 --> 01:12:37.200
that's defined by your craving.

2761
01:12:38.060 --> 01:12:39.400
You know, when you're really,

2762
01:12:39.500 --> 01:12:40.020
really hungry,

2763
01:12:40.020 --> 01:12:42.360
it proves the existence of food.

2764
01:12:42.980 --> 01:12:44.480
When you're really, really horny,

2765
01:12:44.580 --> 01:12:46.060
it proves the existence of sex.

2766
01:12:46.760 --> 01:12:46.980
Right?

2767
01:12:47.360 --> 01:12:48.560
And so when you're really,

2768
01:12:48.720 --> 01:12:49.620
really are seeking

2769
01:12:50.600 --> 01:12:52.380
the complex singularity,

2770
01:12:52.580 --> 01:12:54.020
the source of all truth,

2771
01:12:54.440 --> 01:12:56.780
the cosmic oneness,

2772
01:12:57.220 --> 01:12:58.560
it's proof that it exists.

2773
01:12:59.320 --> 01:13:00.640
But what is it?

2774
01:13:00.660 --> 01:13:01.440
But what is it?

2775
01:13:01.520 --> 01:13:03.000
Okay, so that's what different traditions

2776
01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:04.880
have been trying to explain

2777
01:13:04.880 --> 01:13:05.640
for the longest time.

2778
01:13:05.780 --> 01:13:07.120
This is really interesting though,

2779
01:13:07.140 --> 01:13:07.540
by the way,

2780
01:13:07.640 --> 01:13:08.680
I don't want to just let that

2781
01:13:08.680 --> 01:13:09.280
roll past.

2782
01:13:09.280 --> 01:13:11.280
Hunger is the proof

2783
01:13:11.280 --> 01:13:12.280
that there is food.

2784
01:13:12.480 --> 01:13:13.640
The desire for sex is proof

2785
01:13:13.640 --> 01:13:14.520
that there is sex.

2786
01:13:14.780 --> 01:13:15.720
The desire for it.

2787
01:13:15.720 --> 01:13:17.100
Or it's evidence that there is sex.

2788
01:13:17.240 --> 01:13:18.820
It's not a proof in the classical sense,

2789
01:13:18.900 --> 01:13:20.340
but it's evidence that it exists.

2790
01:13:20.620 --> 01:13:20.700
Evidence.

2791
01:13:21.080 --> 01:13:22.000
And so it'd be really,

2792
01:13:22.100 --> 01:13:22.760
really, really weird

2793
01:13:22.760 --> 01:13:24.320
if you had a craving for something

2794
01:13:24.320 --> 01:13:26.060
and the object of the craving didn't exist.

2795
01:13:26.160 --> 01:13:27.220
It doesn't really make sense.

2796
01:13:27.740 --> 01:13:29.380
And so if you have a craving

2797
01:13:29.380 --> 01:13:30.200
for the oneness.

2798
01:13:30.540 --> 01:13:32.240
Arthur Brooks, this is good.

2799
01:13:32.360 --> 01:13:33.320
And this is, by the way,

2800
01:13:33.360 --> 01:13:34.420
this is one of the reasons

2801
01:13:34.420 --> 01:13:35.600
that when all of the conversations

2802
01:13:35.600 --> 01:13:36.700
that we're having about AI,

2803
01:13:37.580 --> 01:13:38.700
they're all misguided.

2804
01:13:38.700 --> 01:13:41.240
AI can't give us what we want.

2805
01:13:41.780 --> 01:13:42.640
It can't.

2806
01:13:42.860 --> 01:13:44.060
Because all it does

2807
01:13:44.060 --> 01:13:45.280
is gives us complicating

2808
01:13:45.280 --> 01:13:46.340
engineering solutions

2809
01:13:46.340 --> 01:13:48.400
for a simulacrum for the thing

2810
01:13:48.400 --> 01:13:50.760
that we're for a simulation

2811
01:13:50.760 --> 01:13:52.860
for the thing that we really, really want,

2812
01:13:53.080 --> 01:13:54.980
which is a different species of problem.

2813
01:13:55.640 --> 01:13:56.700
You know, what we really want

2814
01:13:56.700 --> 01:13:59.440
is the object of all the complexity

2815
01:13:59.440 --> 01:13:59.960
of the universe.

2816
01:14:00.180 --> 01:14:02.060
Complexity is simple to understand

2817
01:14:02.060 --> 01:14:03.300
and impossible to solve.

2818
01:14:03.940 --> 01:14:05.760
Complication is hard to solve,

2819
01:14:05.820 --> 01:14:06.380
but possible.

2820
01:14:07.080 --> 01:14:08.360
All of the reasons

2821
01:14:08.360 --> 01:14:09.820
all these things that we do in tech

2822
01:14:09.820 --> 01:14:11.880
that are that promise everything

2823
01:14:11.880 --> 01:14:13.200
and deliver nothing but loneliness.

2824
01:14:13.440 --> 01:14:14.880
The reason is because

2825
01:14:14.880 --> 01:14:17.340
they're complicated solutions

2826
01:14:17.340 --> 01:14:18.840
to complex needs.

2827
01:14:19.760 --> 01:14:21.240
Love is complex.

2828
01:14:21.360 --> 01:14:22.620
It's very easy to understand

2829
01:14:22.620 --> 01:14:24.120
and impossible to figure out.

2830
01:14:24.540 --> 01:14:26.140
Your cat is complex,

2831
01:14:26.560 --> 01:14:27.420
very simple,

2832
01:14:27.580 --> 01:14:28.740
but impossible to know

2833
01:14:28.740 --> 01:14:29.400
what it's going to do.

2834
01:14:29.640 --> 01:14:31.580
All the things we really want in life,

2835
01:14:31.660 --> 01:14:33.600
all of our deep desires are complex.

2836
01:14:33.940 --> 01:14:35.420
All of our solutions are complicated.

2837
01:14:36.100 --> 01:14:37.180
And we're throwing

2838
01:14:37.180 --> 01:14:39.480
complicated solutions at complex problems,

2839
01:14:39.540 --> 01:14:41.340
and we're not getting happier.

2840
01:14:42.140 --> 01:14:43.160
And so the only way that we

2841
01:14:43.160 --> 01:14:43.680
can do this

2842
01:14:43.680 --> 01:14:45.660
is to take quiet time

2843
01:14:45.660 --> 01:14:47.720
in contemplation of the complex.

2844
01:14:48.340 --> 01:14:49.460
That's the solution.

2845
01:14:49.780 --> 01:14:50.840
Now, are you going to find it?

2846
01:14:50.900 --> 01:14:52.120
No, no,

2847
01:14:52.200 --> 01:14:54.000
but it's just like happiness.

2848
01:14:54.160 --> 01:14:55.180
You're not going to find it.

2849
01:14:55.380 --> 01:14:57.420
You're going to make progress toward it.

2850
01:14:57.520 --> 01:15:00.840
The goal, the metaphysical goal,

2851
01:15:00.900 --> 01:15:02.660
the transcendental goal

2852
01:15:02.660 --> 01:15:05.000
of a spiritual or philosophical life

2853
01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:08.100
is the approach to the complex oneness,

2854
01:15:08.240 --> 01:15:10.300
to the ultimate truth that we crave.

2855
01:15:10.540 --> 01:15:12.700
And you got to do the work.

2856
01:15:13.180 --> 01:15:15.500
Stop distracting yourself with social media.

2857
01:15:15.660 --> 01:15:17.440
Stop distracting yourself by saying,

2858
01:15:17.560 --> 01:15:18.420
if I make the money,

2859
01:15:18.520 --> 01:15:19.460
then everything will be okay.

2860
01:15:19.560 --> 01:15:20.760
Or if I have the precision,

2861
01:15:20.880 --> 01:15:22.380
this gets us back to the idols.

2862
01:15:23.400 --> 01:15:25.320
Aquinas said that we crave God,

2863
01:15:26.320 --> 01:15:29.000
but God is complex and hard to understand

2864
01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:30.280
and has all kinds of demands

2865
01:15:31.240 --> 01:15:32.360
and winds us up

2866
01:15:32.360 --> 01:15:34.000
in all sorts of one-sided conversations.

2867
01:15:35.400 --> 01:15:38.340
And so, we take a complicated solution

2868
01:15:38.340 --> 01:15:39.840
to the complex problem

2869
01:15:40.360 --> 01:15:42.220
and things that are kind of God-like.

2870
01:15:42.500 --> 01:15:43.180
You know, social media

2871
01:15:43.180 --> 01:15:45.640
is kind of social life-like,

2872
01:15:45.840 --> 01:15:47.600
which is why when we're lonely,

2873
01:15:47.720 --> 01:15:48.300
we'll binge it,

2874
01:15:48.720 --> 01:15:49.960
but it doesn't help.

2875
01:15:50.520 --> 01:15:52.160
And the social media equivalent

2876
01:15:52.160 --> 01:15:53.760
for what we want in God,

2877
01:15:53.820 --> 01:15:54.480
according to Aquinas,

2878
01:15:54.660 --> 01:15:57.000
is fourfold, money, power, pleasure,

2879
01:15:57.380 --> 01:15:57.900
and honor,

2880
01:15:58.560 --> 01:16:00.540
by which he meant fame or admiration

2881
01:16:00.540 --> 01:16:01.220
or prestige.

2882
01:16:02.080 --> 01:16:03.740
That's what he said to the four things.

2883
01:16:03.740 --> 01:16:04.660
And those are the idols.

2884
01:16:04.800 --> 01:16:06.080
And everybody's got their idol

2885
01:16:06.080 --> 01:16:08.460
that when they're not on their game

2886
01:16:08.460 --> 01:16:10.480
looking for the cosmic oneness,

2887
01:16:10.560 --> 01:16:11.660
despite the fact that they'll never

2888
01:16:11.660 --> 01:16:12.240
find it,

2889
01:16:12.380 --> 01:16:13.840
they'll say, okay, fine, I'm tired.

2890
01:16:13.940 --> 01:16:14.960
I'm gonna go do that thing

2891
01:16:14.960 --> 01:16:17.120
that's a simulation for it.

2892
01:16:17.560 --> 01:16:19.320
And it always runs you in the

2893
01:16:19.320 --> 01:16:19.760
wrong direction.

2894
01:16:20.260 --> 01:16:21.440
It runs you in the wrong direction.

2895
01:16:21.640 --> 01:16:22.780
And only when you know what your

2896
01:16:22.780 --> 01:16:23.540
idol is,

2897
01:16:24.040 --> 01:16:25.480
can you actually manage yourself.

2898
01:16:25.780 --> 01:16:26.980
So you say, oh, I'm doing that again.

2899
01:16:27.600 --> 01:16:28.320
I'm doing that again.

2900
01:16:28.360 --> 01:16:29.280
I'm looking for money again

2901
01:16:29.280 --> 01:16:30.620
when what I really wanted was love.

2902
01:16:31.340 --> 01:16:33.100
I'm looking for admiration again

2903
01:16:33.100 --> 01:16:34.680
when what I really wanted was enlightenment.

2904
01:16:35.580 --> 01:16:36.740
Because you didn't want to do the

2905
01:16:36.740 --> 01:16:37.420
work for enlightenment.

2906
01:16:37.600 --> 01:16:38.860
So you went and did the easy thing,

2907
01:16:38.920 --> 01:16:39.660
which was getting the idol.

2908
01:16:40.540 --> 01:16:43.020
So is enlightenment a stand-in for God?

2909
01:16:43.440 --> 01:16:44.780
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2910
01:16:44.820 --> 01:16:46.080
I mean, the whole point is that

2911
01:16:46.080 --> 01:16:46.920
these are...

2912
01:16:46.920 --> 01:16:47.820
Enlightenment is something...

2913
01:16:49.500 --> 01:16:53.180
Enlightenment would be what Christians

2914
01:16:53.180 --> 01:16:54.640
or Muslims

2915
01:16:54.640 --> 01:16:56.420
would call the beatific vision,

2916
01:16:56.560 --> 01:16:58.680
which is to finally lay your eyes

2917
01:16:58.680 --> 01:16:59.380
on the face of God,

2918
01:16:59.820 --> 01:17:01.080
which is actual truth.

2919
01:17:01.340 --> 01:17:02.140
If you're a Buddhist,

2920
01:17:02.140 --> 01:17:05.180
it means because you finally understand.

2921
01:17:05.900 --> 01:17:07.320
You're sitting under the Bodhi tree

2922
01:17:07.320 --> 01:17:10.880
and you finally get it is what

2923
01:17:10.880 --> 01:17:11.420
it comes to.

2924
01:17:11.840 --> 01:17:13.640
You know, we in the monotheistic traditions,

2925
01:17:13.760 --> 01:17:14.780
we don't believe you get it on

2926
01:17:14.780 --> 01:17:15.400
this side of death.

2927
01:17:16.180 --> 01:17:17.040
Buddhists think that you actually

2928
01:17:17.040 --> 01:17:17.720
can achieve it,

2929
01:17:17.800 --> 01:17:19.320
but be that as it may.

2930
01:17:20.340 --> 01:17:21.980
I mean, I don't know.

2931
01:17:22.500 --> 01:17:23.680
I have my hypothesis.

2932
01:17:24.560 --> 01:17:26.080
But I do know that we all

2933
01:17:26.080 --> 01:17:27.500
need to move toward it.

2934
01:17:27.520 --> 01:17:28.360
We all need to do the work

2935
01:17:28.360 --> 01:17:28.800
toward it.

2936
01:17:29.160 --> 01:17:31.040
And getting the AI is not going

2937
01:17:31.040 --> 01:17:31.480
to do it.

2938
01:17:32.140 --> 01:17:33.380
Anymore than Facebook is going to

2939
01:17:33.380 --> 01:17:33.580
do it.

2940
01:17:33.580 --> 01:17:35.480
Interesting that you're linking...

2941
01:17:35.480 --> 01:17:38.800
Because I don't think of AI as God,

2942
01:17:39.040 --> 01:17:40.720
but I hear a lot of people

2943
01:17:40.720 --> 01:17:42.260
talk about that,

2944
01:17:42.340 --> 01:17:43.760
that it will end up being God-like.

2945
01:17:43.800 --> 01:17:45.000
So it's interesting if they really

2946
01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:49.100
are looking for that in AI.

2947
01:17:49.380 --> 01:17:50.760
I think what I'm looking for...

2948
01:17:50.760 --> 01:17:51.720
I'm trying to fill the whole God

2949
01:17:51.720 --> 01:17:52.600
-like hole with it,

2950
01:17:52.700 --> 01:17:53.220
is all I'm saying.

2951
01:17:53.220 --> 01:17:54.760
So I will grant you that for

2952
01:17:54.760 --> 01:17:55.620
anybody doing that,

2953
01:17:55.680 --> 01:17:57.180
that would be a tremendous mistake.

2954
01:17:57.240 --> 01:17:58.660
And I'll give you my thesis on

2955
01:17:58.660 --> 01:17:59.660
what I think all this is in

2956
01:17:59.660 --> 01:17:59.940
a second.

2957
01:17:59.940 --> 01:18:02.680
But AI, I think, for me anyway,

2958
01:18:02.900 --> 01:18:06.560
it is to finally get answers to

2959
01:18:06.560 --> 01:18:07.340
the complex,

2960
01:18:07.720 --> 01:18:10.180
which may be your entire definition

2961
01:18:10.180 --> 01:18:10.600
of God.

2962
01:18:10.760 --> 01:18:12.720
But that's an exercise in futility.

2963
01:18:12.820 --> 01:18:13.360
That's interesting.

2964
01:18:13.660 --> 01:18:15.420
I don't know that I would agree

2965
01:18:15.420 --> 01:18:15.720
with that.

2966
01:18:16.060 --> 01:18:17.760
So I feel like...

2967
01:18:17.760 --> 01:18:18.520
Look, I don't have...

2968
01:18:18.960 --> 01:18:20.280
The data that I have to back

2969
01:18:20.280 --> 01:18:22.100
up the following is merely physics.

2970
01:18:22.280 --> 01:18:22.480
Right.

2971
01:18:22.720 --> 01:18:23.820
As we grow...

2972
01:18:24.820 --> 01:18:24.900
Huh?

2973
01:18:25.080 --> 01:18:26.900
Well, we don't understand physics.

2974
01:18:26.960 --> 01:18:27.740
Simple physics.

2975
01:18:28.260 --> 01:18:29.820
The reason I bring that up is

2976
01:18:29.820 --> 01:18:33.420
because as we strip layers off that onion,

2977
01:18:33.800 --> 01:18:35.700
it unlocks things that we couldn't

2978
01:18:35.700 --> 01:18:36.320
do before.

2979
01:18:36.960 --> 01:18:38.340
And all of us have grown up

2980
01:18:38.340 --> 01:18:39.960
in a world where Einsteinian,

2981
01:18:40.140 --> 01:18:41.640
Einsteinian, whichever way you would

2982
01:18:41.640 --> 01:18:42.020
say that,

2983
01:18:42.380 --> 01:18:43.720
physics already exists.

2984
01:18:43.820 --> 01:18:44.060
Yeah.

2985
01:18:44.240 --> 01:18:46.000
And not realizing that before that

2986
01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:46.960
it was Newtonian physics.

2987
01:18:47.040 --> 01:18:47.160
Right.

2988
01:18:47.160 --> 01:18:48.980
And that the shift between the two

2989
01:18:48.980 --> 01:18:51.240
unlocked the modern world.

2990
01:18:51.440 --> 01:18:51.560
Right.

2991
01:18:51.860 --> 01:18:53.980
And we think of him as just

2992
01:18:53.980 --> 01:18:55.240
sort of this crazy haired guy.

2993
01:18:55.240 --> 01:18:57.420
And we forget that so many of

2994
01:18:57.420 --> 01:18:58.320
the things that we rely on in

2995
01:18:58.320 --> 01:18:58.900
the modern world

2996
01:18:58.900 --> 01:19:01.100
required us to understand that breakthrough.

2997
01:19:01.100 --> 01:19:03.740
But it isn't the universal principle yet.

2998
01:19:03.800 --> 01:19:04.560
We haven't gotten there.

2999
01:19:04.800 --> 01:19:05.960
We haven't got Higgs boson, which

3000
01:19:05.960 --> 01:19:07.980
will show...

3001
01:19:07.980 --> 01:19:10.040
Which will render Einsteinian physics

3002
01:19:10.040 --> 01:19:11.360
obsolete in all kinds of ways.

3003
01:19:11.500 --> 01:19:12.000
Fingers crossed.

3004
01:19:12.540 --> 01:19:15.800
So as we begin to unlock these

3005
01:19:15.800 --> 01:19:16.860
things and truly understand them,

3006
01:19:16.940 --> 01:19:20.620
it really does open up avenues of technology.

3007
01:19:20.840 --> 01:19:22.700
Now, one has to be careful not

3008
01:19:22.700 --> 01:19:24.360
to view technology as a God.

3009
01:19:24.360 --> 01:19:28.100
But if we can use AI to

3010
01:19:28.100 --> 01:19:29.780
either augment our own intelligence

3011
01:19:29.780 --> 01:19:32.020
or for it to itself be intelligent.

3012
01:19:32.140 --> 01:19:33.640
Now, I'm wildly conflicted by AI.

3013
01:19:33.780 --> 01:19:34.720
Let me be abundantly clear.

3014
01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:35.460
We all are.

3015
01:19:35.620 --> 01:19:35.840
Yes.

3016
01:19:35.940 --> 01:19:37.160
Deploying it as fast as I can.

3017
01:19:37.160 --> 01:19:38.660
And at the same time, I'm terrified.

3018
01:19:40.240 --> 01:19:43.320
But I want those answers have real

3019
01:19:43.320 --> 01:19:44.180
world implications.

3020
01:19:44.360 --> 01:19:45.720
That's the moral of my story.

3021
01:19:46.100 --> 01:19:46.300
Yeah.

3022
01:19:46.420 --> 01:19:47.000
Yeah, for sure.

3023
01:19:47.120 --> 01:19:47.520
Absolutely.

3024
01:19:47.580 --> 01:19:47.900
They do.

3025
01:19:48.060 --> 01:19:50.200
But the point is that AI and

3026
01:19:50.200 --> 01:19:51.280
all of these particular tools,

3027
01:19:51.300 --> 01:19:53.720
they solve a different species of problem.

3028
01:19:53.720 --> 01:19:55.300
Yeah, they are not going to answer

3029
01:19:55.300 --> 01:19:55.680
the God.

3030
01:19:55.980 --> 01:19:57.560
They're not going to, because they can't.

3031
01:19:57.780 --> 01:19:59.900
And the whole idea is that there's

3032
01:19:59.900 --> 01:20:00.680
always this concept

3033
01:20:00.680 --> 01:20:03.300
that we could understand everything

3034
01:20:03.300 --> 01:20:05.140
if we had sufficient computational horsepower.

3035
01:20:05.540 --> 01:20:06.660
But that's not right.

3036
01:20:07.100 --> 01:20:10.480
Because you can't solve complex problems,

3037
01:20:10.860 --> 01:20:11.940
which are mathematically different

3038
01:20:11.940 --> 01:20:13.020
than complicated problems.

3039
01:20:13.160 --> 01:20:13.300
Yes.

3040
01:20:13.400 --> 01:20:15.020
Give me an example of...

3041
01:20:15.020 --> 01:20:16.040
So for people that don't know,

3042
01:20:16.180 --> 01:20:17.900
you did applied mathematics for a while.

3043
01:20:17.980 --> 01:20:19.260
So it's not me asking some random

3044
01:20:19.260 --> 01:20:19.920
guy off the street.

3045
01:20:20.140 --> 01:20:21.720
Give me an example of...

3046
01:20:21.720 --> 01:20:23.720
A complex and a complicated problem.

3047
01:20:23.820 --> 01:20:25.860
Yes, because in math, the only thing

3048
01:20:25.860 --> 01:20:26.600
I can think of,

3049
01:20:26.940 --> 01:20:28.620
because I am wildly ignorant, I would

3050
01:20:28.620 --> 01:20:29.760
like to be abundantly clear.

3051
01:20:29.900 --> 01:20:32.600
But from my just not knowing math

3052
01:20:32.600 --> 01:20:33.480
at all perspective,

3053
01:20:33.600 --> 01:20:35.320
the only category of thing in math

3054
01:20:35.320 --> 01:20:36.540
that I know as being complex

3055
01:20:36.540 --> 01:20:39.140
would be something like the pi.

3056
01:20:39.680 --> 01:20:43.160
So pi is, if Yosha Bach is correct,

3057
01:20:43.300 --> 01:20:45.060
better understood as a function rather

3058
01:20:45.060 --> 01:20:45.680
than a number

3059
01:20:45.680 --> 01:20:47.460
because you can never know the final

3060
01:20:47.460 --> 01:20:48.100
digit of pi.

3061
01:20:48.180 --> 01:20:48.880
It's a relationship.

3062
01:20:49.660 --> 01:20:50.140
Interesting.

3063
01:20:50.180 --> 01:20:50.680
Yeah, it's a relationship.

3064
01:20:50.680 --> 01:20:52.720
So I'll give you an example of two.

3065
01:20:52.860 --> 01:20:53.540
Is that complex?

3066
01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:56.560
Yeah, well, it's a good question whether

3067
01:20:56.560 --> 01:20:57.180
or not it's complex.

3068
01:20:57.320 --> 01:20:58.100
I think about it in a slightly

3069
01:20:58.100 --> 01:20:58.480
different way.

3070
01:20:58.500 --> 01:20:59.460
So I'll give you an example that

3071
01:20:59.460 --> 01:21:01.900
might make it clearer.

3072
01:21:02.400 --> 01:21:05.400
So a complicated problem is one that

3073
01:21:05.400 --> 01:21:10.400
has 75 equations and 75 unknowns.

3074
01:21:11.060 --> 01:21:13.700
It's a highly dimensional mathematical problem

3075
01:21:13.700 --> 01:21:16.120
that it would just take tons of

3076
01:21:16.120 --> 01:21:18.580
computational horsepower to figure out.

3077
01:21:18.640 --> 01:21:19.400
But there is a solution.

3078
01:21:20.320 --> 01:21:23.380
Designing a jet engine is an incredibly

3079
01:21:23.380 --> 01:21:24.300
complicated problem.

3080
01:21:24.400 --> 01:21:26.460
Making a toaster is a complicated problem.

3081
01:21:26.580 --> 01:21:27.200
You know, if you try to do

3082
01:21:27.200 --> 01:21:28.580
one out in your garage with, you know,

3083
01:21:28.660 --> 01:21:30.060
stuff that's sitting around your house,

3084
01:21:30.100 --> 01:21:31.280
you'll probably burn your house down

3085
01:21:31.280 --> 01:21:32.340
if you try to make toast with it.

3086
01:21:32.600 --> 01:21:34.020
It's a very complicated thing to do.

3087
01:21:34.080 --> 01:21:35.660
But once you do it, you can

3088
01:21:35.660 --> 01:21:37.100
do it over and over and over again

3089
01:21:37.100 --> 01:21:38.440
with almost complete accuracy.

3090
01:21:38.980 --> 01:21:41.620
That's these are complex, complicated problems.

3091
01:21:41.980 --> 01:21:44.180
A complex problem is a football game.

3092
01:21:44.520 --> 01:21:46.340
A football game is a complicated problem

3093
01:21:46.340 --> 01:21:47.740
where I don't care how good your

3094
01:21:47.740 --> 01:21:48.340
computer is.

3095
01:21:48.340 --> 01:21:49.220
You're not going to be able to

3096
01:21:49.220 --> 01:21:51.560
tell me the outcome because it's complex.

3097
01:21:51.600 --> 01:21:52.280
It's complex.

3098
01:21:52.520 --> 01:21:53.940
It's I think I misspoke.

3099
01:21:54.080 --> 01:21:55.960
You said complicated ones and complex ones.

3100
01:21:56.120 --> 01:21:58.220
But yeah, it's a complex problem.

3101
01:21:58.580 --> 01:22:00.400
A complex problem is incredibly simple

3102
01:22:00.400 --> 01:22:01.320
to understand the outcome.

3103
01:22:01.840 --> 01:22:04.200
You know, the Patriots score higher

3104
01:22:04.200 --> 01:22:04.840
than the Broncos.

3105
01:22:05.580 --> 01:22:07.860
That's, you know, the natural order

3106
01:22:07.860 --> 01:22:10.440
of things that they that is just

3107
01:22:10.980 --> 01:22:12.620
one team has a higher score than

3108
01:22:12.620 --> 01:22:13.260
the other and wins.

3109
01:22:13.360 --> 01:22:13.840
Very simple.

3110
01:22:13.980 --> 01:22:14.580
Incredibly simple.

3111
01:22:15.380 --> 01:22:19.060
But it's unbelievably, the permutations

3112
01:22:19.060 --> 01:22:22.580
are so vast that you can't simulate it.

3113
01:22:22.860 --> 01:22:24.080
And you don't think that's knowable

3114
01:22:24.080 --> 01:22:25.100
with enough computation?

3115
01:22:25.120 --> 01:22:27.040
It's not knowable with enough computation.

3116
01:22:27.260 --> 01:22:29.340
But actually, and even if that one

3117
01:22:29.340 --> 01:22:30.340
turns out to be,

3118
01:22:30.540 --> 01:22:32.460
that turns out to be not a

3119
01:22:32.460 --> 01:22:34.220
complex problem, but a complicated problem.

3120
01:22:34.360 --> 01:22:36.020
There are complex problems like the

3121
01:22:36.020 --> 01:22:36.900
problem of love.

3122
01:22:37.560 --> 01:22:39.620
The problem of love is very simple.

3123
01:22:40.080 --> 01:22:41.660
And yet it's not something that you

3124
01:22:41.660 --> 01:22:43.180
can simulate in any real way.

3125
01:22:43.180 --> 01:22:44.060
Some people will say, well, you have

3126
01:22:44.060 --> 01:22:44.900
your AI girlfriend.

3127
01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:47.320
You've cracked the code of love.

3128
01:22:47.380 --> 01:22:48.100
No, you haven't.

3129
01:22:48.500 --> 01:22:50.300
There's nobody watching us right now.

3130
01:22:50.380 --> 01:22:51.580
It's like, yeah, AI girlfriend just

3131
01:22:51.580 --> 01:22:51.900
as good.

3132
01:22:52.580 --> 01:22:54.720
No, no, AI girlfriend, a substitute

3133
01:22:54.720 --> 01:22:56.060
because I can't get the real thing

3134
01:22:56.420 --> 01:22:57.620
is what it would come down to.

3135
01:22:57.680 --> 01:22:59.100
That's the difference between pornography

3136
01:22:59.100 --> 01:23:01.200
and sex with your wife.

3137
01:23:01.560 --> 01:23:01.680
All right.

3138
01:23:01.680 --> 01:23:03.360
When two smart people who are well

3139
01:23:03.360 --> 01:23:04.840
-meaning think the other person is crazy,

3140
01:23:04.960 --> 01:23:06.120
you know, they have different based assumptions.

3141
01:23:06.740 --> 01:23:08.060
So to me, that sounds crazy.

3142
01:23:08.620 --> 01:23:11.700
And the reason is that I believe

3143
01:23:11.700 --> 01:23:13.340
we're in a deterministic universe.

3144
01:23:13.540 --> 01:23:14.720
I'm guessing you do not.

3145
01:23:15.280 --> 01:23:16.980
I don't believe we're in a deterministic universe.

3146
01:23:17.060 --> 01:23:18.740
I believe we're in a stochastic universe.

3147
01:23:18.880 --> 01:23:19.900
Okay, define stochastic.

3148
01:23:20.020 --> 01:23:21.760
Stochastic means there's randomness

3149
01:23:21.760 --> 01:23:22.460
in the universe.

3150
01:23:22.900 --> 01:23:24.540
My father was a biostatistician, a

3151
01:23:24.540 --> 01:23:25.760
PhD biostatistician,

3152
01:23:25.920 --> 01:23:27.040
and he was a devout Christian.

3153
01:23:27.320 --> 01:23:28.520
I said, what gives dad?

3154
01:23:28.740 --> 01:23:29.960
You know, I'm an adolescent, what gives?

3155
01:23:30.320 --> 01:23:31.100
And he said, you don't understand.

3156
01:23:31.680 --> 01:23:33.200
He said, you know what miracles are?

3157
01:23:33.860 --> 01:23:34.780
And I said, what?

3158
01:23:34.780 --> 01:23:37.720
He said, events that are five standard

3159
01:23:37.720 --> 01:23:39.580
deviations away from the mean.

3160
01:23:39.620 --> 01:23:41.380
They're way out of the tails of

3161
01:23:41.380 --> 01:23:42.120
the curves.

3162
01:23:42.260 --> 01:23:43.580
You know, the greatest gift that God

3163
01:23:43.580 --> 01:23:45.940
ever gave the world was a distribution,

3164
01:23:46.280 --> 01:23:48.620
a random distribution of events.

3165
01:23:49.360 --> 01:23:51.400
He believed, and I think it's actually

3166
01:23:51.400 --> 01:23:52.600
more than plausible,

3167
01:23:52.740 --> 01:23:54.340
I think it's most likely that the

3168
01:23:54.340 --> 01:23:57.000
universe is actually has randomness

3169
01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:57.460
in it,

3170
01:23:57.640 --> 01:24:00.180
which means it cannot be, you can't

3171
01:24:00.180 --> 01:24:02.080
get to a single point on most

3172
01:24:02.080 --> 01:24:02.480
of the,

3173
01:24:02.620 --> 01:24:04.080
or any of the complex problems.

3174
01:24:04.080 --> 01:24:06.640
You can't, and so you can simulate

3175
01:24:06.640 --> 01:24:07.840
a kind of a version of a

3176
01:24:07.840 --> 01:24:08.740
curve fit,

3177
01:24:09.280 --> 01:24:11.400
but you can't actually get underneath

3178
01:24:11.400 --> 01:24:13.680
them and simulate them properly

3179
01:24:13.680 --> 01:24:15.680
because we have a stochastic universe

3180
01:24:15.680 --> 01:24:18.200
and we live with deterministic brains.

3181
01:24:18.560 --> 01:24:20.480
Our brains say that this happens to

3182
01:24:20.480 --> 01:24:21.420
this and this happens to this.

3183
01:24:21.520 --> 01:24:22.820
We have a supercomputer that's good enough.

3184
01:24:22.860 --> 01:24:23.980
We can figure out how it all

3185
01:24:23.980 --> 01:24:24.480
hangs together.

3186
01:24:24.700 --> 01:24:26.740
And that's the supposition behind

3187
01:24:26.740 --> 01:24:30.740
Einsteinian physics or Newtonian physics,

3188
01:24:31.520 --> 01:24:33.500
that there's a deterministic structure

3189
01:24:33.500 --> 01:24:35.160
underneath that we're simulating.

3190
01:24:35.260 --> 01:24:36.260
We're doing the best that we can

3191
01:24:36.260 --> 01:24:37.640
to put a model on top.

3192
01:24:37.720 --> 01:24:40.400
It's a map, but that's actually probably

3193
01:24:40.400 --> 01:24:41.900
not the way that the universe works.

3194
01:24:42.500 --> 01:24:43.460
And if that's the case, and if

3195
01:24:43.460 --> 01:24:45.540
we have a craving for the source

3196
01:24:45.540 --> 01:24:46.200
of that,

3197
01:24:46.700 --> 01:24:51.580
then it's something, someone, some entity

3198
01:24:52.040 --> 01:24:54.220
that can be the origin of that

3199
01:24:54.220 --> 01:24:55.160
complexity per se.

3200
01:24:55.240 --> 01:24:55.740
What is it?

3201
01:24:55.960 --> 01:24:56.680
What is it?

3202
01:24:56.800 --> 01:24:58.200
You know, it's like maybe my model,

3203
01:24:58.320 --> 01:24:58.540
which is,

3204
01:24:58.660 --> 01:24:59.480
yeah, I got the Bible and I

3205
01:24:59.480 --> 01:25:00.460
got God and I got that whole thing.

3206
01:25:00.460 --> 01:25:01.220
Maybe that's nuts.

3207
01:25:01.600 --> 01:25:04.600
Maybe it's nuts, but it's a hypothesis.

3208
01:25:05.660 --> 01:25:08.020
And it says that we can't get

3209
01:25:08.020 --> 01:25:09.140
it from the stuff.

3210
01:25:09.720 --> 01:25:11.040
We can't get it from the stuff.

3211
01:25:11.580 --> 01:25:13.260
You can only get it by looking

3212
01:25:13.260 --> 01:25:15.720
for it, looking for the true thing.

3213
01:25:15.780 --> 01:25:17.100
And that's the reason I think that

3214
01:25:17.100 --> 01:25:18.300
really great intellectual life

3215
01:25:18.300 --> 01:25:20.780
requires that we have both an intellectual

3216
01:25:20.780 --> 01:25:22.360
pursuit and a spiritual pursuit

3217
01:25:22.360 --> 01:25:23.960
and that we need to undertake these

3218
01:25:23.960 --> 01:25:24.560
things in parallel.

3219
01:25:24.800 --> 01:25:25.960
I think that's the only responsible

3220
01:25:25.960 --> 01:25:26.620
course of action.

3221
01:25:27.100 --> 01:25:28.700
What's happening when you're looking

3222
01:25:28.700 --> 01:25:29.580
for it?

3223
01:25:29.580 --> 01:25:31.780
I can give you, I don't know

3224
01:25:31.780 --> 01:25:33.000
that Buddhists would agree with this,

3225
01:25:33.100 --> 01:25:34.500
but I think they would.

3226
01:25:35.460 --> 01:25:37.160
What you're getting by looking at

3227
01:25:37.160 --> 01:25:38.040
it in a Buddhist

3228
01:25:38.040 --> 01:25:39.920
or looking for it in a Buddhist tradition

3229
01:25:39.920 --> 01:25:41.180
is you're getting out from under the

3230
01:25:41.180 --> 01:25:44.120
illusion of perception.

3231
01:25:44.940 --> 01:25:47.160
That's definitely a Western look at

3232
01:25:47.160 --> 01:25:49.160
it, but that feels pretty accurate.

3233
01:25:50.140 --> 01:25:51.300
That's a good way of explaining it.

3234
01:25:51.560 --> 01:25:53.080
That's a good way of explaining Buddhist

3235
01:25:53.080 --> 01:25:54.660
thinking on it,

3236
01:25:54.920 --> 01:25:57.500
that you're no longer bound by the illusions.

3237
01:25:58.280 --> 01:26:01.200
What, in the language that we're developing here,

3238
01:26:01.300 --> 01:26:03.000
you're no longer bound by your models.

3239
01:26:03.620 --> 01:26:05.760
You're actually able to see the road

3240
01:26:05.760 --> 01:26:07.280
as opposed to staring at the map

3241
01:26:07.280 --> 01:26:08.540
all the time.

3242
01:26:08.820 --> 01:26:09.880
It's like, you know, we're looking

3243
01:26:09.880 --> 01:26:11.260
at, we got our devices and we're

3244
01:26:11.260 --> 01:26:12.140
looking at the GPS.

3245
01:26:12.500 --> 01:26:13.440
If you just stare at the GPS,

3246
01:26:13.580 --> 01:26:14.720
you're going to crash in your car.

3247
01:26:14.880 --> 01:26:16.840
You're actually driving on a road

3248
01:26:16.840 --> 01:26:18.100
in real physical life,

3249
01:26:18.100 --> 01:26:19.560
but you're more and more and more

3250
01:26:19.560 --> 01:26:20.780
divorced from that

3251
01:26:20.780 --> 01:26:23.640
when you're stuck with the models.

3252
01:26:23.760 --> 01:26:25.260
And those are the illusions that I

3253
01:26:25.260 --> 01:26:26.340
would say that you're trying to free

3254
01:26:26.340 --> 01:26:27.060
yourself from

3255
01:26:27.060 --> 01:26:29.720
by actually imbibing some of the oxygen

3256
01:26:29.720 --> 01:26:31.280
in real life around you.

3257
01:26:31.460 --> 01:26:33.880
Okay, so if that's the Buddhist take

3258
01:26:33.880 --> 01:26:37.440
on it, what is the Catholic take

3259
01:26:37.440 --> 01:26:37.780
on it?

3260
01:26:37.860 --> 01:26:39.000
The Catholic take on it is very

3261
01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:42.100
similar, which is that there is underlying reality,

3262
01:26:42.460 --> 01:26:44.440
but that underlying reality is not

3263
01:26:44.440 --> 01:26:48.220
always apparent and for all sorts

3264
01:26:48.220 --> 01:26:48.660
of reasons.

3265
01:26:48.860 --> 01:26:50.800
And that the underlying reality is

3266
01:26:50.800 --> 01:26:53.800
made by God and-

3267
01:26:53.800 --> 01:26:55.040
Yeah, it is the realm of God.

3268
01:26:55.040 --> 01:26:56.940
We just don't have the capacity or

3269
01:26:56.940 --> 01:26:59.520
the preparation to be able to experience.

3270
01:26:59.700 --> 01:27:01.040
Now, Plato talked about this.

3271
01:27:01.100 --> 01:27:02.100
He was pre-Christian.

3272
01:27:02.840 --> 01:27:04.160
Plato talked about this, about his

3273
01:27:04.160 --> 01:27:07.640
analogy of the shadows on the cave wall.

3274
01:27:07.800 --> 01:27:09.460
The closest that we can get to

3275
01:27:09.460 --> 01:27:10.740
actually seeing what's going on

3276
01:27:10.740 --> 01:27:12.340
is the shadows of what's going on

3277
01:27:12.340 --> 01:27:14.540
behind the fire in the cave wall.

3278
01:27:15.780 --> 01:27:18.880
A lot of the German philosophers from

3279
01:27:18.880 --> 01:27:20.280
the 17th and 18th centuries

3280
01:27:20.280 --> 01:27:21.780
and 19th centuries would talk about

3281
01:27:21.780 --> 01:27:22.200
this too.

3282
01:27:22.200 --> 01:27:23.560
So that Schopenhauer, for example,

3283
01:27:23.660 --> 01:27:24.280
Arthur Schopenhauer,

3284
01:27:24.460 --> 01:27:26.820
obviously one of the greatest early

3285
01:27:26.820 --> 01:27:27.500
19th century,

3286
01:27:27.620 --> 01:27:29.020
mid-19th century philosophers would

3287
01:27:29.020 --> 01:27:29.860
talk about villa,

3288
01:27:30.080 --> 01:27:32.100
which was the sense of will that

3289
01:27:32.100 --> 01:27:33.540
the reality exists,

3290
01:27:33.660 --> 01:27:36.120
but we can't see it because we're

3291
01:27:36.120 --> 01:27:37.380
just not competent.

3292
01:27:38.140 --> 01:27:38.980
And we're trying to put one foot

3293
01:27:38.980 --> 01:27:39.660
in front of another.

3294
01:27:39.840 --> 01:27:42.660
And so we create an edifice that

3295
01:27:42.660 --> 01:27:44.000
allows us to live,

3296
01:27:44.080 --> 01:27:45.660
but we can't actually see the reality,

3297
01:27:45.800 --> 01:27:47.660
that the complex reality is happening

3298
01:27:47.660 --> 01:27:49.120
behind it all the time.

3299
01:27:49.120 --> 01:27:49.880
What do you think these guys were

3300
01:27:49.880 --> 01:27:50.620
struggling with?

3301
01:27:50.620 --> 01:27:52.440
And maybe you're from your perspective,

3302
01:27:52.460 --> 01:27:55.780
the obvious answer is just God, but-

3303
01:27:55.780 --> 01:27:56.720
I don't know if it's just God,

3304
01:27:56.940 --> 01:27:57.900
but that's a word for it.

3305
01:27:58.020 --> 01:27:59.160
They were struggling for something.

3306
01:27:59.240 --> 01:28:00.020
They had a craving.

3307
01:28:00.560 --> 01:28:03.180
Because here is the modern take on that.

3308
01:28:04.080 --> 01:28:05.340
You're in a simulation.

3309
01:28:05.660 --> 01:28:07.660
Now, some people believe you're in

3310
01:28:07.660 --> 01:28:09.200
a literal computer simulation

3311
01:28:09.200 --> 01:28:10.440
and other people like me,

3312
01:28:10.500 --> 01:28:12.160
I don't necessarily have evidence

3313
01:28:12.160 --> 01:28:13.700
that you're in an actual computer simulation,

3314
01:28:13.860 --> 01:28:15.300
but I do have evidence that your

3315
01:28:15.300 --> 01:28:17.080
brain is simulating reality

3316
01:28:17.080 --> 01:28:18.320
as a way so that you can

3317
01:28:18.320 --> 01:28:18.980
grapple with it.

3318
01:28:18.980 --> 01:28:20.260
Because instead of seeing blue,

3319
01:28:20.660 --> 01:28:22.200
if you just saw the number of

3320
01:28:22.200 --> 01:28:23.660
photons in a given wavelength

3321
01:28:23.660 --> 01:28:25.260
that are reflecting off that surface

3322
01:28:25.260 --> 01:28:26.100
and into your eye,

3323
01:28:26.520 --> 01:28:27.800
it's so complicated.

3324
01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:29.600
So your brain is just taking this

3325
01:28:29.600 --> 01:28:31.400
incredibly complex universe,

3326
01:28:31.520 --> 01:28:32.380
which by the way, for people that

3327
01:28:32.380 --> 01:28:32.860
don't know,

3328
01:28:33.460 --> 01:28:35.740
the human, our ability to perceive

3329
01:28:35.740 --> 01:28:38.320
the actual electromagnetic spectrum

3330
01:28:38.320 --> 01:28:40.500
is 0.0035%.

3331
01:28:41.400 --> 01:28:44.740
So you're like way, way less than

3332
01:28:44.740 --> 01:28:45.320
half a percent-

3333
01:28:45.320 --> 01:28:46.880
Tons of dimensionality doesn't exist.

3334
01:28:47.080 --> 01:28:48.340
There's tons of things we can't see.

3335
01:28:48.340 --> 01:28:50.400
So we've taken this gigantically complex

3336
01:28:50.400 --> 01:28:50.400
thing-

3337
01:28:50.400 --> 01:28:51.760
We know the things we can't see.

3338
01:28:51.880 --> 01:28:52.660
Yeah, for sure.

3339
01:28:52.700 --> 01:28:52.820
Yeah.

3340
01:28:53.100 --> 01:28:55.220
And we boil it down into something

3341
01:28:55.220 --> 01:28:57.820
that is just an absolute sliver of

3342
01:28:57.820 --> 01:28:58.460
the reality.

3343
01:28:59.060 --> 01:29:01.900
So, okay, in a modern context, I

3344
01:29:01.900 --> 01:29:02.460
get it.

3345
01:29:02.580 --> 01:29:05.200
But like, what were they coming up

3346
01:29:05.200 --> 01:29:07.660
against in whatever 2,000 years ago

3347
01:29:07.660 --> 01:29:10.420
when Plato's describing the shadows

3348
01:29:10.420 --> 01:29:12.200
on the cave wall?

3349
01:29:12.300 --> 01:29:13.700
What is he grappling with?

3350
01:29:14.040 --> 01:29:15.960
Like it's, as far as I can tell,

3351
01:29:15.960 --> 01:29:18.420
he's getting underneath, like realizing,

3352
01:29:18.700 --> 01:29:21.880
oh, my perceptions do not equate to reality.

3353
01:29:22.180 --> 01:29:24.400
And once you accept that, like everything

3354
01:29:24.400 --> 01:29:25.520
begins to unwind.

3355
01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:26.980
Well, it doesn't begin to unwind.

3356
01:29:27.080 --> 01:29:28.880
It begins to free you to this

3357
01:29:28.880 --> 01:29:30.100
understanding that you're-

3358
01:29:30.100 --> 01:29:31.220
You begin to see its illusions.

3359
01:29:31.420 --> 01:29:32.940
You begin to see that you are

3360
01:29:32.940 --> 01:29:34.800
living in a world of illusion.

3361
01:29:35.620 --> 01:29:39.580
Now, how is this that we can

3362
01:29:40.400 --> 01:29:41.840
militate against that by saying it's

3363
01:29:41.840 --> 01:29:43.480
all in a simulation?

3364
01:29:43.480 --> 01:29:45.600
And part of the simulation is that

3365
01:29:45.600 --> 01:29:46.400
we're simulated.

3366
01:29:46.920 --> 01:29:49.200
The simulation creates the illusion

3367
01:29:49.200 --> 01:29:50.500
that there is something bigger,

3368
01:29:50.520 --> 01:29:51.580
even though there isn't.

3369
01:29:51.980 --> 01:29:53.700
But that's just explaining something away.

3370
01:29:53.820 --> 01:29:55.600
So, in a philosophical basis, the

3371
01:29:55.600 --> 01:29:56.680
way I talk about this with my students,

3372
01:29:56.780 --> 01:29:59.280
I say, okay, we got three choices,

3373
01:29:59.680 --> 01:30:01.160
three doors to go through Monty.

3374
01:30:02.040 --> 01:30:04.140
This is for those of us, that's

3375
01:30:04.140 --> 01:30:05.960
the Monty Hall game in economics

3376
01:30:05.960 --> 01:30:07.140
is based on Let's Make a Deal,

3377
01:30:07.200 --> 01:30:08.840
this old game show that was on

3378
01:30:08.840 --> 01:30:09.800
when I was a kid, right?

3379
01:30:09.880 --> 01:30:11.600
And you get the contestants would

3380
01:30:11.600 --> 01:30:12.120
have to choose

3381
01:30:12.120 --> 01:30:14.840
one of these three doors and then

3382
01:30:14.840 --> 01:30:15.860
the door would open up

3383
01:30:15.860 --> 01:30:16.560
and it would turn out you either

3384
01:30:16.560 --> 01:30:17.160
got a car,

3385
01:30:17.300 --> 01:30:18.120
you got a living room set or

3386
01:30:18.120 --> 01:30:19.960
you got a goat or something like that.

3387
01:30:20.580 --> 01:30:22.680
So, there's basically three choices

3388
01:30:22.680 --> 01:30:23.300
about that,

3389
01:30:23.360 --> 01:30:25.980
about how you're gonna see the existence

3390
01:30:25.980 --> 01:30:28.400
of an underlying reality

3391
01:30:28.400 --> 01:30:30.140
that you can or cannot perceive

3392
01:30:30.140 --> 01:30:32.000
and you can or cannot get closer

3393
01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:33.040
to and make progress toward.

3394
01:30:33.580 --> 01:30:34.920
It has to do with the two

3395
01:30:34.920 --> 01:30:36.780
concepts of essence and existence.

3396
01:30:37.640 --> 01:30:39.660
We believe, we all believe that we exist.

3397
01:30:39.660 --> 01:30:41.220
I mean, you can relax that by

3398
01:30:41.220 --> 01:30:42.000
saying it's a simulation,

3399
01:30:42.200 --> 01:30:43.420
we don't actually exist, I don't know,

3400
01:30:43.480 --> 01:30:45.420
but let's leave that for a moment.

3401
01:30:45.680 --> 01:30:46.460
And let's just say that we all

3402
01:30:46.460 --> 01:30:47.380
agree that there's existence.

3403
01:30:47.520 --> 01:30:50.080
What we don't agree on is the

3404
01:30:50.080 --> 01:30:51.280
nature of essence.

3405
01:30:51.460 --> 01:30:52.520
Essence is meaning.

3406
01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:55.600
So, I'm alive and my life has meaning.

3407
01:30:56.160 --> 01:30:58.960
Okay, now the traditional philosophical understanding,

3408
01:30:59.060 --> 01:31:00.600
the platonic understanding of this,

3409
01:31:00.680 --> 01:31:02.360
the ancient Greek understanding of this,

3410
01:31:02.440 --> 01:31:06.420
the Christian, Jewish, Hindu,

3411
01:31:07.880 --> 01:31:09.800
Muslim, for sure, understanding of this

3412
01:31:09.800 --> 01:31:12.160
is that essence precedes existence.

3413
01:31:12.760 --> 01:31:13.660
Let's think about that for a second.

3414
01:31:13.980 --> 01:31:16.740
The meaning of your life existed before

3415
01:31:16.740 --> 01:31:17.420
you were born.

3416
01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:19.840
Your job is to live up to

3417
01:31:19.840 --> 01:31:20.240
that meaning,

3418
01:31:20.320 --> 01:31:21.960
to find that meaning and live up

3419
01:31:21.960 --> 01:31:22.520
to that meaning.

3420
01:31:22.640 --> 01:31:24.680
It existed, it's a cosmic thing.

3421
01:31:24.800 --> 01:31:26.960
That's what comes from the cosmic oneness.

3422
01:31:27.920 --> 01:31:31.620
The modern existentialist view, modern philosophy,

3423
01:31:31.880 --> 01:31:33.200
a lot of it would say that

3424
01:31:33.200 --> 01:31:35.540
existence precedes essence.

3425
01:31:35.540 --> 01:31:37.280
You're born without any meaning.

3426
01:31:37.560 --> 01:31:39.060
You have to invent meaning the best

3427
01:31:39.060 --> 01:31:39.460
you can.

3428
01:31:39.620 --> 01:31:40.660
Good luck, that's Sartre.

3429
01:31:41.100 --> 01:31:42.440
Like, go sit in a French cafe

3430
01:31:42.440 --> 01:31:43.700
and smoke filterless cigarettes

3431
01:31:43.700 --> 01:31:44.340
and feel depressed.

3432
01:31:45.020 --> 01:31:46.760
As existence precedes essence.

3433
01:31:47.340 --> 01:31:49.000
Now, the third, the middle way, the

3434
01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:50.020
most depressing way

3435
01:31:50.020 --> 01:31:51.920
is the Nietzschean way, which is the

3436
01:31:51.920 --> 01:31:52.700
nihilistic way

3437
01:31:52.700 --> 01:31:55.660
that says existence exists and essence doesn't.

3438
01:31:55.820 --> 01:31:56.940
There is no meaning.

3439
01:31:57.300 --> 01:31:58.920
The only responsible course of action

3440
01:31:58.920 --> 01:31:59.360
in a life

3441
01:31:59.360 --> 01:32:01.000
is to give up on essence.

3442
01:32:01.560 --> 01:32:02.240
There is no meaning.

3443
01:32:02.620 --> 01:32:03.980
Stop looking for God, stop looking

3444
01:32:03.980 --> 01:32:04.500
for enlightenment,

3445
01:32:04.500 --> 01:32:05.620
stop looking for all of it.

3446
01:32:06.100 --> 01:32:06.960
That created-

3447
01:32:06.960 --> 01:32:08.580
He said you couldn't apply meaning?

3448
01:32:08.820 --> 01:32:10.120
He said there is no meaning.

3449
01:32:10.580 --> 01:32:12.020
There is no meaning.

3450
01:32:12.180 --> 01:32:13.620
Life has no meaning.

3451
01:32:14.160 --> 01:32:15.320
So you can't apply, because the first

3452
01:32:15.320 --> 01:32:15.640
one is,

3453
01:32:15.720 --> 01:32:16.580
there is no meaning, but you can

3454
01:32:16.580 --> 01:32:17.180
apply meaning.

3455
01:32:17.540 --> 01:32:19.040
That there, the first one is that

3456
01:32:19.040 --> 01:32:19.680
there is meaning.

3457
01:32:19.820 --> 01:32:20.940
You need to find it and live

3458
01:32:20.940 --> 01:32:21.380
up to it.

3459
01:32:21.400 --> 01:32:21.520
I see.

3460
01:32:21.620 --> 01:32:22.860
So the second is that there is

3461
01:32:22.860 --> 01:32:23.260
no meaning

3462
01:32:23.260 --> 01:32:24.580
until you create it.

3463
01:32:25.060 --> 01:32:26.440
And the last is that there is

3464
01:32:26.440 --> 01:32:26.840
no meaning.

3465
01:32:27.340 --> 01:32:27.660
Got it.

3466
01:32:27.780 --> 01:32:29.520
And you can keep looking for it

3467
01:32:29.520 --> 01:32:31.200
and you can keep trying to create it.

3468
01:32:31.240 --> 01:32:33.880
But that's childish.

3469
01:32:34.500 --> 01:32:36.460
Let it go, let it go.

3470
01:32:36.660 --> 01:32:37.660
That's nihilism.

3471
01:32:38.200 --> 01:32:40.220
That's why we call somebody who's nihilistic

3472
01:32:40.220 --> 01:32:41.300
somebody who believes that there is

3473
01:32:41.300 --> 01:32:41.600
no meaning

3474
01:32:41.600 --> 01:32:42.240
and nothing matters.

3475
01:32:42.500 --> 01:32:43.860
That's the reason we call it that

3476
01:32:43.860 --> 01:32:45.240
in the popular vernacular.

3477
01:32:46.040 --> 01:32:47.500
So these are the kind of the

3478
01:32:47.500 --> 01:32:48.180
three choices

3479
01:32:48.180 --> 01:32:49.500
that we have to walk through.

3480
01:32:50.300 --> 01:32:53.340
For most of all of existence of humanity,

3481
01:32:53.640 --> 01:32:55.060
it's been door number one,

3482
01:32:55.700 --> 01:32:57.320
which is that there is essence.

3483
01:32:57.900 --> 01:33:00.280
And then we experience existence.

3484
01:33:01.040 --> 01:33:02.500
And the whole point of life

3485
01:33:02.500 --> 01:33:04.640
is to figure out and pursue essence

3486
01:33:04.640 --> 01:33:08.360
and responsible in a way that's generative

3487
01:33:08.360 --> 01:33:09.260
and meaningful.

3488
01:33:09.760 --> 01:33:11.200
And that's what we're trying to do.

3489
01:33:11.300 --> 01:33:13.180
That's what I think is most compelling.

3490
01:33:13.460 --> 01:33:15.060
I think that's the most compelling view.

3491
01:33:15.260 --> 01:33:17.640
I don't know the truth.

3492
01:33:18.580 --> 01:33:19.720
You know, and by the way,

3493
01:33:19.740 --> 01:33:21.100
when I've talked to Sam Harris about this,

3494
01:33:21.140 --> 01:33:22.580
he agrees with me that there's things

3495
01:33:22.580 --> 01:33:23.200
that we don't see,

3496
01:33:23.440 --> 01:33:24.560
that there is essence

3497
01:33:25.060 --> 01:33:27.640
that we can only barely perceive.

3498
01:33:28.880 --> 01:33:30.340
And all of the things that I

3499
01:33:30.340 --> 01:33:31.020
talk about

3500
01:33:31.660 --> 01:33:33.960
from Catholicism to the stochastic nature

3501
01:33:33.960 --> 01:33:36.020
of the statistical set of circumstances

3502
01:33:36.020 --> 01:33:36.920
in which we find ourselves,

3503
01:33:37.360 --> 01:33:39.020
from the science to the religion

3504
01:33:39.580 --> 01:33:41.280
is my understanding,

3505
01:33:41.420 --> 01:33:42.360
my best understanding,

3506
01:33:42.480 --> 01:33:44.360
my fumbling around in the dark

3507
01:33:44.360 --> 01:33:46.140
and looking at shadows on the cave wall

3508
01:33:47.440 --> 01:33:49.260
for what I'm trying to do

3509
01:33:49.260 --> 01:33:50.780
to find the essence

3510
01:33:51.500 --> 01:33:54.780
that will give meaning to my existence.

3511
01:33:55.620 --> 01:33:56.820
That's the point of my life.

3512
01:33:57.600 --> 01:33:58.720
It's very interesting.

3513
01:33:59.040 --> 01:34:01.340
So it goes back to

3514
01:34:01.340 --> 01:34:02.760
what are we grappling with here?

3515
01:34:02.940 --> 01:34:06.720
So I'm going to define my version

3516
01:34:06.720 --> 01:34:08.360
of what I think the God-shaped

3517
01:34:08.360 --> 01:34:08.880
hole is.

3518
01:34:08.980 --> 01:34:09.060
Yeah.

3519
01:34:09.220 --> 01:34:10.320
And I'm going to put it in

3520
01:34:10.320 --> 01:34:10.720
the context

3521
01:34:10.720 --> 01:34:12.420
of the language we've been using here.

3522
01:34:12.960 --> 01:34:14.620
Because I come at everything

3523
01:34:14.620 --> 01:34:15.880
from an evolutionary lens.

3524
01:34:15.980 --> 01:34:16.080
Right.

3525
01:34:16.280 --> 01:34:17.700
And I'm very much of-

3526
01:34:17.700 --> 01:34:18.480
It's a good lens, by the way.

3527
01:34:18.540 --> 01:34:18.900
Thank you.

3528
01:34:18.900 --> 01:34:20.540
It really helps you understand a lot.

3529
01:34:20.560 --> 01:34:21.920
It has been very helpful.

3530
01:34:21.920 --> 01:34:24.580
Evolutionary psychology is just the best.

3531
01:34:24.700 --> 01:34:25.920
It's bizarrely controversial,

3532
01:34:25.920 --> 01:34:27.080
which I will never understand.

3533
01:34:27.440 --> 01:34:28.640
But nonetheless,

3534
01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:30.920
it has been extremely useful in my life.

3535
01:34:31.180 --> 01:34:32.520
So I come at it from that.

3536
01:34:32.680 --> 01:34:33.500
So I'm like, okay,

3537
01:34:33.540 --> 01:34:34.920
if we do have this hole

3538
01:34:34.920 --> 01:34:37.040
and it is a yearning

3539
01:34:37.040 --> 01:34:38.160
and that yearning is evidence

3540
01:34:38.160 --> 01:34:39.320
that there is something,

3541
01:34:39.580 --> 01:34:41.240
what is the nature of the yearning

3542
01:34:41.240 --> 01:34:42.420
and what is the thing that I'm

3543
01:34:42.420 --> 01:34:42.920
yearning for?

3544
01:34:43.720 --> 01:34:45.200
And again, using the language

3545
01:34:45.200 --> 01:34:46.640
of this conversation,

3546
01:34:47.600 --> 01:34:49.160
I have a feeling

3547
01:34:49.840 --> 01:34:51.400
that humans have

3548
01:34:51.400 --> 01:34:54.660
a very intrinsic,

3549
01:34:54.900 --> 01:34:56.880
evolutionarily derived desire

3550
01:34:56.880 --> 01:34:58.400
to kneel before something.

3551
01:34:59.780 --> 01:35:01.820
And now the question becomes,

3552
01:35:01.980 --> 01:35:03.380
okay, if you have this push

3553
01:35:03.380 --> 01:35:04.700
to kneel before something,

3554
01:35:05.120 --> 01:35:05.800
why?

3555
01:35:06.040 --> 01:35:07.820
What is the evolutionary advantage

3556
01:35:07.820 --> 01:35:09.520
to those that kneel before the thing?

3557
01:35:10.180 --> 01:35:12.140
And the best answer

3558
01:35:12.140 --> 01:35:13.520
that I can come up with

3559
01:35:13.520 --> 01:35:15.120
is that you need to get out

3560
01:35:15.120 --> 01:35:16.780
of the me self

3561
01:35:16.780 --> 01:35:17.980
and you need to get into the

3562
01:35:17.980 --> 01:35:18.520
I self

3563
01:35:18.520 --> 01:35:20.060
and you need to create that distance.

3564
01:35:20.700 --> 01:35:22.900
And by kneeling before something,

3565
01:35:23.020 --> 01:35:25.400
by making something bigger than you,

3566
01:35:25.860 --> 01:35:27.360
now, one, you're just,

3567
01:35:27.560 --> 01:35:28.720
you are in the habit

3568
01:35:28.720 --> 01:35:30.240
of living your life in service

3569
01:35:30.240 --> 01:35:31.600
of something beyond yourself.

3570
01:35:31.820 --> 01:35:31.960
Right.

3571
01:35:33.300 --> 01:35:34.760
I don't think,

3572
01:35:34.980 --> 01:35:36.460
this is definitely just ignorance,

3573
01:35:36.560 --> 01:35:37.340
so you will help me here.

3574
01:35:37.660 --> 01:35:40.400
I don't think that any of the world's

3575
01:35:41.300 --> 01:35:42.260
lasting religions

3576
01:35:42.260 --> 01:35:44.760
would compel you to serve

3577
01:35:44.760 --> 01:35:46.520
anything other than,

3578
01:35:46.620 --> 01:35:47.340
ah, this will be interesting.

3579
01:35:47.440 --> 01:35:48.300
I actually don't know the answer to

3580
01:35:48.300 --> 01:35:48.600
this question.

3581
01:35:48.600 --> 01:35:49.820
I will be very shocked if you

3582
01:35:49.820 --> 01:35:50.200
tell me

3583
01:35:50.200 --> 01:35:51.860
that any lasting religion

3584
01:35:51.860 --> 01:35:53.920
has asked people to serve

3585
01:35:53.920 --> 01:35:56.580
anything other than either humanity itself

3586
01:35:56.580 --> 01:35:58.500
or a God that loves humanity.

3587
01:35:59.580 --> 01:36:00.320
Is there?

3588
01:36:01.380 --> 01:36:02.700
No doubt there are.

3589
01:36:02.860 --> 01:36:04.400
No doubt there are religions that,

3590
01:36:04.460 --> 01:36:05.580
but they're, I guess,

3591
01:36:05.660 --> 01:36:07.560
but you stipulated to lasting religions.

3592
01:36:07.860 --> 01:36:08.540
Yeah, because I don't see

3593
01:36:08.540 --> 01:36:09.640
how that would be beneficial.

3594
01:36:09.820 --> 01:36:11.820
Because ultimately what I'm saying

3595
01:36:11.820 --> 01:36:12.660
is the proxy,

3596
01:36:13.060 --> 01:36:14.060
the God-shaped hole

3597
01:36:14.060 --> 01:36:14.920
is actually a desire

3598
01:36:14.920 --> 01:36:15.920
to serve your fellow man,

3599
01:36:15.980 --> 01:36:17.100
because that's going to be the thing

3600
01:36:17.100 --> 01:36:17.780
that keeps you alive.

3601
01:36:17.780 --> 01:36:19.380
Because you're way better off

3602
01:36:19.380 --> 01:36:20.260
coming together as a group.

3603
01:36:20.740 --> 01:36:21.140
Evolutionary.

3604
01:36:21.420 --> 01:36:22.300
Yes, is my gut.

3605
01:36:22.540 --> 01:36:23.920
And then religion,

3606
01:36:24.140 --> 01:36:25.320
like the specific,

3607
01:36:25.940 --> 01:36:27.520
whether oral or written tradition,

3608
01:36:27.900 --> 01:36:29.440
is the thing that allowed humans

3609
01:36:29.440 --> 01:36:32.160
to come together in gigantic swaths

3610
01:36:32.160 --> 01:36:33.960
in a way that no other species,

3611
01:36:34.180 --> 01:36:34.760
no other creature,

3612
01:36:34.860 --> 01:36:35.360
not ants,

3613
01:36:35.500 --> 01:36:37.140
nothing can come together

3614
01:36:37.140 --> 01:36:39.220
in the flexible fashion that we can

3615
01:36:39.220 --> 01:36:42.460
by using ideas of religion.

3616
01:36:42.600 --> 01:36:44.180
Like those just give you an instant bond.

3617
01:36:44.320 --> 01:36:45.860
And I'm willing to kill for

3618
01:36:45.860 --> 01:36:47.320
and die for this thing

3619
01:36:47.320 --> 01:36:48.220
that we have in common.

3620
01:36:48.580 --> 01:36:48.980
Yeah, yeah.

3621
01:36:52.100 --> 01:36:54.680
I also have a huge amount of

3622
01:36:54.680 --> 01:36:55.740
time and admiration

3623
01:36:55.740 --> 01:36:57.600
for evolutionary psychology,

3624
01:36:58.280 --> 01:36:59.940
but it's totally descriptive.

3625
01:37:00.640 --> 01:37:03.260
And it's neither prescriptive

3626
01:37:03.260 --> 01:37:04.380
nor deterministic.

3627
01:37:05.120 --> 01:37:06.820
So I don't believe

3628
01:37:06.820 --> 01:37:08.120
that the evolutionary psychology

3629
01:37:08.120 --> 01:37:09.460
of the things that actually set out

3630
01:37:09.460 --> 01:37:11.300
our impulses and imperatives,

3631
01:37:11.700 --> 01:37:13.740
that they prescribe

3632
01:37:13.740 --> 01:37:15.400
nor proscribe particular behavior.

3633
01:37:15.620 --> 01:37:16.860
I think that we have choices

3634
01:37:16.860 --> 01:37:18.240
way beyond our evolution.

3635
01:37:19.220 --> 01:37:20.580
So let me get an example.

3636
01:37:21.140 --> 01:37:22.540
We talked about Mother Nature.

3637
01:37:22.800 --> 01:37:24.220
She has really two goals for you.

3638
01:37:24.440 --> 01:37:25.820
And all of evolutionary psychology

3639
01:37:25.820 --> 01:37:26.880
comes down to survival

3640
01:37:26.880 --> 01:37:28.660
and gene propagation.

3641
01:37:29.440 --> 01:37:30.340
That's what all of, you know,

3642
01:37:30.600 --> 01:37:31.700
the evolutionary psychologists

3643
01:37:31.700 --> 01:37:32.820
and evolutionary biologists,

3644
01:37:32.920 --> 01:37:33.680
they say that all that

3645
01:37:34.840 --> 01:37:36.340
any organism exists for

3646
01:37:36.340 --> 01:37:38.120
is to survive long enough

3647
01:37:38.120 --> 01:37:38.880
to pass on its genes.

3648
01:37:39.520 --> 01:37:40.680
And so it all comes down to that.

3649
01:37:40.980 --> 01:37:44.300
But virtually everybody believes

3650
01:37:44.300 --> 01:37:46.540
that we can short circuit that

3651
01:37:46.540 --> 01:37:47.180
and make decisions

3652
01:37:47.180 --> 01:37:47.940
that go beyond that.

3653
01:37:48.440 --> 01:37:49.020
We can do all.

3654
01:37:49.200 --> 01:37:50.020
And so people will say,

3655
01:37:50.120 --> 01:37:51.280
OK, well, you laid down

3656
01:37:51.280 --> 01:37:52.340
your life for a stranger,

3657
01:37:52.340 --> 01:37:53.740
but that was because you had

3658
01:37:53.740 --> 01:37:54.820
some evolutionary impulse

3659
01:37:54.820 --> 01:37:56.240
to behave in an altruistic way

3660
01:37:56.240 --> 01:37:58.040
that dates back to a time

3661
01:37:58.040 --> 01:37:58.760
when that would have been better

3662
01:37:58.760 --> 01:38:00.260
for your tribe, etc., etc., etc.

3663
01:38:00.500 --> 01:38:02.200
I think that the better explanation

3664
01:38:02.200 --> 01:38:03.900
for that is the animal path

3665
01:38:03.900 --> 01:38:04.980
versus the divine path.

3666
01:38:05.080 --> 01:38:06.900
The animal path is incredibly powerful.

3667
01:38:07.380 --> 01:38:09.160
It's a wonderful model

3668
01:38:09.160 --> 01:38:10.040
for understanding

3669
01:38:10.040 --> 01:38:11.480
why most things happen

3670
01:38:11.480 --> 01:38:12.520
and why we have the impulses

3671
01:38:12.520 --> 01:38:13.060
that we do.

3672
01:38:13.660 --> 01:38:15.140
But the most interesting questions

3673
01:38:15.140 --> 01:38:16.080
of the divine path

3674
01:38:16.080 --> 01:38:17.940
where we actually make decisions

3675
01:38:17.940 --> 01:38:19.740
that go beyond

3676
01:38:20.960 --> 01:38:23.320
what our evolutionary evolution

3677
01:38:23.320 --> 01:38:25.320
would suggest is the best path for us,

3678
01:38:25.560 --> 01:38:27.080
that go beyond the things

3679
01:38:27.080 --> 01:38:28.260
that we want to do,

3680
01:38:28.700 --> 01:38:30.400
that help us to understand

3681
01:38:30.400 --> 01:38:31.740
that there could actually

3682
01:38:31.740 --> 01:38:32.620
be something bigger.

3683
01:38:33.540 --> 01:38:35.480
And this is the really unique thing

3684
01:38:35.480 --> 01:38:36.300
about the human species

3685
01:38:36.300 --> 01:38:38.320
is that we can make this election

3686
01:38:38.320 --> 01:38:39.460
between divine and animal,

3687
01:38:39.580 --> 01:38:40.140
divine and animal.

3688
01:38:40.240 --> 01:38:41.460
And every day is this election

3689
01:38:41.460 --> 01:38:42.460
between divine and animal.

3690
01:38:42.740 --> 01:38:44.560
And in fact, to look

3691
01:38:45.140 --> 01:38:48.100
for the source of the complex oneness

3692
01:38:48.100 --> 01:38:51.060
in a world of complex ingenuity,

3693
01:38:51.280 --> 01:38:52.880
a complicated ingenuity,

3694
01:38:53.420 --> 01:38:54.840
that's to choose the divine path.

3695
01:38:55.060 --> 01:38:56.680
Ultimately, the divine path

3696
01:38:56.680 --> 01:38:58.200
or the animal path in the biggest way.

3697
01:38:59.360 --> 01:39:00.960
So not everybody agrees with me.

3698
01:39:01.240 --> 01:39:02.500
A lot of really smart people

3699
01:39:02.500 --> 01:39:03.300
disagree with me and say

3700
01:39:03.300 --> 01:39:04.800
all the things that we actually do,

3701
01:39:04.880 --> 01:39:06.380
they still come back to evolution,

3702
01:39:06.420 --> 01:39:07.820
even if they don't look like

3703
01:39:07.820 --> 01:39:09.140
this is an evolutionarily

3704
01:39:09.820 --> 01:39:10.900
adaptive thing to do.

3705
01:39:10.980 --> 01:39:11.920
It sort of is.

3706
01:39:11.940 --> 01:39:12.880
You just need a more complicated

3707
01:39:12.880 --> 01:39:14.620
understanding of the evolutionary impulse.

3708
01:39:15.060 --> 01:39:15.500
I disagree.

3709
01:39:16.220 --> 01:39:17.360
I think that there's,

3710
01:39:17.440 --> 01:39:18.520
man, evolutionary biology,

3711
01:39:18.660 --> 01:39:19.780
it just puts us on this track

3712
01:39:19.780 --> 01:39:21.060
and makes us act in particular ways.

3713
01:39:21.140 --> 01:39:22.500
Yeah, we got all these habits

3714
01:39:22.500 --> 01:39:23.380
and things that we want to do.

3715
01:39:23.520 --> 01:39:25.200
And then we can decide not to

3716
01:39:25.200 --> 01:39:25.700
do them

3717
01:39:26.180 --> 01:39:28.040
because we want something higher,

3718
01:39:28.080 --> 01:39:29.760
because we're called to something higher,

3719
01:39:29.780 --> 01:39:32.260
because we have a dim perception

3720
01:39:32.260 --> 01:39:33.900
of something that's bigger,

3721
01:39:34.100 --> 01:39:35.380
that's something that's better

3722
01:39:35.380 --> 01:39:36.880
that we're drawn toward.

3723
01:39:37.400 --> 01:39:39.760
And that's the oneness

3724
01:39:39.760 --> 01:39:41.300
that we're distracted from

3725
01:39:41.300 --> 01:39:42.160
when we're basically

3726
01:39:42.160 --> 01:39:43.600
just sitting on the animal path

3727
01:39:43.600 --> 01:39:44.800
and doing money, power, pleasure, fame,

3728
01:39:44.900 --> 01:39:45.800
money, power, pleasure, fame.

3729
01:39:46.660 --> 01:39:48.120
And so instead of getting on our knees

3730
01:39:48.120 --> 01:39:50.600
and contemplating the nature of enlightenment,

3731
01:39:50.800 --> 01:39:52.080
we'll scroll Instagram.

3732
01:39:53.800 --> 01:39:54.500
That's interesting.

3733
01:39:54.740 --> 01:39:55.980
So as somebody who believes

3734
01:39:55.980 --> 01:39:57.500
that you can't be enlightened

3735
01:39:59.040 --> 01:40:00.020
prior to death,

3736
01:40:01.780 --> 01:40:03.580
what is it about the contemplation

3737
01:40:03.580 --> 01:40:04.640
of that,

3738
01:40:04.800 --> 01:40:06.440
knowing you will never be able

3739
01:40:06.440 --> 01:40:07.380
to actually understand it?

3740
01:40:07.420 --> 01:40:08.680
What is it about the contemplation

3741
01:40:08.680 --> 01:40:10.380
that makes your life better, I presume?

3742
01:40:10.700 --> 01:40:10.940
Progress.

3743
01:40:11.560 --> 01:40:12.840
The progress principle.

3744
01:40:13.180 --> 01:40:13.940
You're getting closer.

3745
01:40:14.060 --> 01:40:14.600
You're getting closer.

3746
01:40:14.860 --> 01:40:16.020
And why not?

3747
01:40:16.520 --> 01:40:17.900
Why would God want it such

3748
01:40:17.900 --> 01:40:20.440
that you can't attain enlightenment?

3749
01:40:20.800 --> 01:40:23.500
Because, well, according to Christian theology,

3750
01:40:23.820 --> 01:40:25.260
I mean, so this becomes a theological question.

3751
01:40:25.360 --> 01:40:27.240
It's because ultimately it's the relationship,

3752
01:40:27.400 --> 01:40:29.040
the beatific vision is the relationship

3753
01:40:29.040 --> 01:40:31.100
with God, him or herself.

3754
01:40:31.340 --> 01:40:33.440
And the way that the Hindus talk

3755
01:40:33.440 --> 01:40:33.740
about this,

3756
01:40:33.780 --> 01:40:34.160
by the way,

3757
01:40:34.180 --> 01:40:36.440
is that the transmigration of the soul

3758
01:40:36.940 --> 01:40:39.000
occurs as people are getting closer

3759
01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:40.380
and closer to enlightenment,

3760
01:40:40.380 --> 01:40:43.060
at which point the soul will be reabsorbed

3761
01:40:43.060 --> 01:40:43.920
into the Godhead.

3762
01:40:44.300 --> 01:40:46.140
So the idea of the soul for Hindus

3763
01:40:46.140 --> 01:40:47.300
is that your soul,

3764
01:40:47.480 --> 01:40:49.300
Tom's soul, is a little chip of God.

3765
01:40:49.840 --> 01:40:52.380
Comes down, enters a human being,

3766
01:40:52.940 --> 01:40:55.000
corrupted by circumstance, et cetera,

3767
01:40:55.320 --> 01:40:57.720
becomes perfected over a hundred

3768
01:40:57.720 --> 01:40:59.060
or a thousand lifetimes,

3769
01:40:59.180 --> 01:41:00.900
and this is reabsorbed into the Godhead.

3770
01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:03.700
And the ultimate goal of to stop samsara,

3771
01:41:03.840 --> 01:41:05.220
the endless cycle of birth and rebirth,

3772
01:41:05.380 --> 01:41:06.700
is to be reabsorbed into God.

3773
01:41:07.820 --> 01:41:09.760
So their understanding of this

3774
01:41:09.760 --> 01:41:11.180
is actually easier to understand,

3775
01:41:11.380 --> 01:41:12.360
weirdly, than just,

3776
01:41:12.460 --> 01:41:13.080
I got to see God.

3777
01:41:13.360 --> 01:41:13.660
Awesome.

3778
01:41:14.100 --> 01:41:14.740
You know, I don't know.

3779
01:41:15.360 --> 01:41:17.000
But it's all basically saying the

3780
01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:17.440
same thing,

3781
01:41:17.540 --> 01:41:19.040
getting closer, getting closer,

3782
01:41:19.320 --> 01:41:20.160
making progress.

3783
01:41:20.580 --> 01:41:21.480
This is the goal in life.

3784
01:41:21.540 --> 01:41:22.720
This is the impulse.

3785
01:41:23.220 --> 01:41:24.120
And how do we do that?

3786
01:41:24.160 --> 01:41:26.200
All kinds of ways that our lives

3787
01:41:26.200 --> 01:41:28.920
are generative and help us do that.

3788
01:41:29.300 --> 01:41:31.940
You know, as silly as, you know,

3789
01:41:31.980 --> 01:41:33.860
doing a podcast, starting a business,

3790
01:41:34.040 --> 01:41:35.480
all these things, they help other people.

3791
01:41:35.600 --> 01:41:36.760
They help us understand ourselves.

3792
01:41:36.960 --> 01:41:37.500
They make life,

3793
01:41:37.500 --> 01:41:39.320
they lessen the burden

3794
01:41:39.320 --> 01:41:40.860
for our brothers and sisters

3795
01:41:40.860 --> 01:41:41.700
in particular ways.

3796
01:41:41.760 --> 01:41:42.920
This is the reason that

3797
01:41:42.920 --> 01:41:45.600
it's so profoundly unsatisfying for you

3798
01:41:45.600 --> 01:41:46.200
to do something,

3799
01:41:46.280 --> 01:41:47.920
it's all me, me, me, me, me,

3800
01:41:48.520 --> 01:41:50.260
as opposed to others, others, others.

3801
01:41:50.360 --> 01:41:51.820
And ultimately you get the juice

3802
01:41:52.760 --> 01:41:54.300
of these generative things,

3803
01:41:54.400 --> 01:41:55.400
of these creative things that you're doing

3804
01:41:55.400 --> 01:41:57.040
when it really does lighten the load

3805
01:41:57.040 --> 01:41:58.840
and improve the lives of other people,

3806
01:41:58.860 --> 01:42:00.620
because that's the process of getting closer,

3807
01:42:00.780 --> 01:42:01.940
the process of getting closer.

3808
01:42:02.240 --> 01:42:03.580
And the physical manifestations

3809
01:42:03.580 --> 01:42:05.780
of the things that we do every day,

3810
01:42:05.780 --> 01:42:06.460
and it gets better.

3811
01:42:07.020 --> 01:42:08.700
And we hope, and again,

3812
01:42:08.760 --> 01:42:09.520
this is one theory.

3813
01:42:09.740 --> 01:42:10.820
I mean, my whole religion,

3814
01:42:10.960 --> 01:42:12.060
I might be completely off base.

3815
01:42:12.160 --> 01:42:13.040
I mean, I can't say,

3816
01:42:13.180 --> 01:42:14.280
because I have no data.

3817
01:42:14.820 --> 01:42:16.900
I can only hypothesize at this point,

3818
01:42:17.160 --> 01:42:20.640
faith is belief without data,

3819
01:42:21.160 --> 01:42:22.560
is belief without evidence.

3820
01:42:23.240 --> 01:42:26.520
It's a set of non-testable hypotheses

3821
01:42:26.520 --> 01:42:28.180
is what it comes down to.

3822
01:42:28.300 --> 01:42:30.440
And it's just that the progress per se

3823
01:42:30.440 --> 01:42:32.360
is the point of what we're trying

3824
01:42:32.360 --> 01:42:33.140
to do on earth.

3825
01:42:33.340 --> 01:42:34.040
That's what the,

3826
01:42:34.120 --> 01:42:35.680
certainly the Dalai Lama would say.

3827
01:42:37.140 --> 01:42:39.800
From life to life, toward enlightenment.

3828
01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:41.020
That's what the Hindus would say

3829
01:42:41.020 --> 01:42:42.440
about the transmigration of the soul

3830
01:42:42.440 --> 01:42:43.840
for the reabsorption of the Godhead.

3831
01:42:43.980 --> 01:42:45.460
That's what Hindus,

3832
01:42:45.860 --> 01:42:47.020
or that's what Buddhists, sorry,

3833
01:42:47.560 --> 01:42:48.920
Muslims and Christians would say

3834
01:42:48.920 --> 01:42:50.320
about trying to actually go to live

3835
01:42:50.320 --> 01:42:51.020
in heaven with God.

3836
01:42:51.520 --> 01:42:53.600
But it's all saying the same thing fundamentally

3837
01:42:53.600 --> 01:42:54.460
about the progress.

3838
01:42:55.320 --> 01:42:58.080
The progress is the point of life.

3839
01:43:00.440 --> 01:43:01.500
Yeah, I don't know why at this

3840
01:43:01.500 --> 01:43:02.020
point in my life,

3841
01:43:02.100 --> 01:43:04.000
this has become such a fascinating question.

3842
01:43:04.420 --> 01:43:05.640
You're right on schedule, by the way.

3843
01:43:06.140 --> 01:43:06.840
No, no, seriously,

3844
01:43:07.120 --> 01:43:09.880
because what you throw off superstition

3845
01:43:09.880 --> 01:43:12.500
and you look for the pure oxygen

3846
01:43:12.500 --> 01:43:13.180
of enlightenment

3847
01:43:13.760 --> 01:43:16.960
and what looks like Jesus and Santa Claus,

3848
01:43:17.020 --> 01:43:17.640
what's the difference?

3849
01:43:17.960 --> 01:43:18.680
You know, when you're 20,

3850
01:43:19.020 --> 01:43:19.960
when you're 50, you're going,

3851
01:43:20.120 --> 01:43:20.720
ah, big difference.

3852
01:43:21.800 --> 01:43:22.940
Yeah, it's interesting.

3853
01:43:23.280 --> 01:43:26.280
There is something about the way

3854
01:43:26.280 --> 01:43:27.360
that the world is moving.

3855
01:43:27.620 --> 01:43:30.480
So my goal in life is to,

3856
01:43:30.580 --> 01:43:32.460
in a really practical way,

3857
01:43:32.460 --> 01:43:38.440
help people live a life of fulfillment.

3858
01:43:38.640 --> 01:43:40.140
And I never quite know how to

3859
01:43:40.140 --> 01:43:40.860
put words to it.

3860
01:43:41.180 --> 01:43:42.640
Fulfillment survives grief.

3861
01:43:43.240 --> 01:43:44.760
And so I'm trying to,

3862
01:43:45.720 --> 01:43:47.300
I have thought a lot about in

3863
01:43:47.300 --> 01:43:47.780
my own life

3864
01:43:47.780 --> 01:43:51.340
and have found tremendous easing of suffering

3865
01:43:51.340 --> 01:43:54.300
in recognizing what I call

3866
01:43:54.300 --> 01:43:56.380
that there is an evolutionary impulse

3867
01:43:56.380 --> 01:43:57.880
to get me to do the things

3868
01:43:57.880 --> 01:44:01.620
that will align myself with having kids

3869
01:44:01.620 --> 01:44:03.160
that survive long enough to have kids, right?

3870
01:44:03.220 --> 01:44:04.860
And so while I don't have to

3871
01:44:04.860 --> 01:44:05.780
do that literally,

3872
01:44:06.080 --> 01:44:08.200
I have to understand what the algorithms are

3873
01:44:08.200 --> 01:44:09.160
that are running in my mind to

3874
01:44:09.160 --> 01:44:09.820
make that happen.

3875
01:44:10.580 --> 01:44:15.240
And the more I explore this space

3876
01:44:15.240 --> 01:44:17.600
of like how one clicks into fulfillment,

3877
01:44:17.980 --> 01:44:20.900
I do find myself grappling with,

3878
01:44:21.140 --> 01:44:22.780
as you get under perception

3879
01:44:22.780 --> 01:44:24.200
and you really start to say,

3880
01:44:24.280 --> 01:44:27.080
okay, what is the bedrock here?

3881
01:44:27.960 --> 01:44:31.040
It does become, I'll say quasi-religious

3882
01:44:31.040 --> 01:44:32.580
because I don't find myself going,

3883
01:44:32.700 --> 01:44:33.800
oh, I'm getting closer and closer

3884
01:44:33.800 --> 01:44:34.300
to God.

3885
01:44:34.400 --> 01:44:35.740
That isn't what it feels like from

3886
01:44:35.740 --> 01:44:36.760
my perspective.

3887
01:44:36.880 --> 01:44:37.720
From my perspective,

3888
01:44:37.720 --> 01:44:39.380
it feels like there is ground truth

3889
01:44:39.840 --> 01:44:41.780
and you can get closer to it.

3890
01:44:41.860 --> 01:44:44.320
And the more you understand how the

3891
01:44:44.320 --> 01:44:45.960
illusion is created,

3892
01:44:46.120 --> 01:44:47.920
the less you are trapped by it.

3893
01:44:48.040 --> 01:44:50.200
And the less you are trapped by

3894
01:44:50.200 --> 01:44:50.860
the matrix

3895
01:44:50.860 --> 01:44:54.020
to use a very fun word,

3896
01:44:54.160 --> 01:44:55.620
evocative way of thinking about it.

3897
01:44:55.740 --> 01:44:56.980
It's one of the most profound movies

3898
01:44:56.980 --> 01:44:57.820
for the past 30 years,

3899
01:44:57.920 --> 01:44:59.240
notwithstanding the cinematography.

3900
01:44:59.240 --> 01:45:01.600
It has to do with the concepts

3901
01:45:01.600 --> 01:45:02.500
underneath it.

3902
01:45:02.640 --> 01:45:03.260
A hundred percent.

3903
01:45:03.600 --> 01:45:06.640
For me, it is the most useful metaphor

3904
01:45:06.640 --> 01:45:07.780
for the human existence.

3905
01:45:08.660 --> 01:45:11.020
And so once I understand how the

3906
01:45:11.020 --> 01:45:12.040
matrix works,

3907
01:45:12.040 --> 01:45:14.740
then I start seeing it in everything.

3908
01:45:14.960 --> 01:45:18.920
I start seeing it in politics,

3909
01:45:18.920 --> 01:45:20.440
which is not something I thought I

3910
01:45:20.440 --> 01:45:21.360
would ever engage with.

3911
01:45:21.440 --> 01:45:22.640
I start seeing it in the culture war,

3912
01:45:22.700 --> 01:45:23.960
another thing I never thought I would

3913
01:45:23.960 --> 01:45:24.800
engage with.

3914
01:45:25.180 --> 01:45:27.560
But as I, I forget what this

3915
01:45:27.560 --> 01:45:28.280
is a reference to.

3916
01:45:28.280 --> 01:45:31.440
This is an allusion to something.

3917
01:45:31.620 --> 01:45:33.280
As I set aside childish things,

3918
01:45:33.500 --> 01:45:37.420
I really come to realize that.

3919
01:45:37.840 --> 01:45:38.760
You just quoted St. Paul.

3920
01:45:39.080 --> 01:45:39.800
Is that what it is?

3921
01:45:40.240 --> 01:45:40.580
That's hilarious.

3922
01:45:40.820 --> 01:45:42.080
I can't even tell you where from,

3923
01:45:42.360 --> 01:45:45.040
but that you begin to realize,

3924
01:45:45.240 --> 01:45:46.480
oh, this is one problem.

3925
01:45:47.060 --> 01:45:49.400
And once you understand it's one problem

3926
01:45:49.400 --> 01:45:51.760
that manifests in all these weird ways,

3927
01:45:52.020 --> 01:45:54.380
helping people get deeper on that ladder,

3928
01:45:54.820 --> 01:45:56.480
because helping people get deeper

3929
01:45:56.480 --> 01:45:57.140
on that ladder

3930
01:45:57.740 --> 01:46:00.440
becomes, is very meaningful to me.

3931
01:46:01.100 --> 01:46:02.900
It's obviously also self-serving

3932
01:46:02.900 --> 01:46:03.960
in that the deeper on the ladder

3933
01:46:03.960 --> 01:46:04.380
I go,

3934
01:46:04.480 --> 01:46:05.620
the more grounded I feel,

3935
01:46:05.760 --> 01:46:07.900
the more I feel resilient to the

3936
01:46:07.900 --> 01:46:08.860
slings and arrows of life,

3937
01:46:08.880 --> 01:46:10.520
the more I feel like facing death

3938
01:46:10.520 --> 01:46:11.480
isn't scary.

3939
01:46:12.600 --> 01:46:14.560
Just all the things, all the things.

3940
01:46:16.440 --> 01:46:17.880
But I am,

3941
01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:21.620
I don't know what to make of

3942
01:46:21.620 --> 01:46:23.040
the fact that

3943
01:46:23.040 --> 01:46:25.120
when I started all of this,

3944
01:46:25.180 --> 01:46:26.960
it was a lot easier to have conversations

3945
01:46:26.960 --> 01:46:28.800
about think like this, act like this,

3946
01:46:29.340 --> 01:46:30.900
and then finding people wouldn't do it.

3947
01:46:31.040 --> 01:46:32.600
And every time I tried to scratch

3948
01:46:32.600 --> 01:46:33.120
as to,

3949
01:46:33.440 --> 01:46:35.040
okay, where were all my own hangups,

3950
01:46:35.580 --> 01:46:38.080
that it has led to me circling

3951
01:46:38.080 --> 01:46:38.800
around this problem

3952
01:46:38.800 --> 01:46:40.380
of the God-shaped hole over and

3953
01:46:40.380 --> 01:46:41.000
over and over.

3954
01:46:42.360 --> 01:46:43.620
It's very fascinating.

3955
01:46:43.760 --> 01:46:44.400
Yeah, no, it is.

3956
01:46:44.500 --> 01:46:47.000
And this is, I mean, psychologists

3957
01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:47.620
and sociologists

3958
01:46:47.620 --> 01:46:49.220
have found that pattern that it tends

3959
01:46:49.220 --> 01:46:49.640
to occur,

3960
01:46:49.760 --> 01:46:51.860
particularly with people who live

3961
01:46:51.860 --> 01:46:52.440
in their heads,

3962
01:46:53.140 --> 01:46:55.520
people who are questioners,

3963
01:46:56.020 --> 01:46:58.080
that they start asking bigger and

3964
01:46:58.080 --> 01:46:58.700
deeper questions

3965
01:46:58.700 --> 01:47:00.660
and the answers that typically come

3966
01:47:00.660 --> 01:47:00.980
to them,

3967
01:47:01.060 --> 01:47:03.740
even with the greatest horsepower

3968
01:47:03.740 --> 01:47:04.960
that the world can provide,

3969
01:47:05.060 --> 01:47:06.600
doesn't give them the truth that they seek.

3970
01:47:06.940 --> 01:47:09.020
It just doesn't give you full flavor.

3971
01:47:09.740 --> 01:47:10.640
It doesn't give you,

3972
01:47:10.720 --> 01:47:12.280
you get lots of interesting solutions.

3973
01:47:12.540 --> 01:47:14.380
Like, yeah, I got a good morning routine.

3974
01:47:15.080 --> 01:47:15.880
It's really good.

3975
01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:18.560
I have to ice bath, workout, whatever happens.

3976
01:47:18.640 --> 01:47:20.240
It's just not good.

3977
01:47:20.860 --> 01:47:22.500
But it's not the thing that I'm seeking.

3978
01:47:22.700 --> 01:47:24.200
You keep finding answers to questions

3979
01:47:24.200 --> 01:47:25.100
that you weren't asking

3980
01:47:25.100 --> 01:47:26.520
and you're not finding the solutions

3981
01:47:26.520 --> 01:47:28.260
to the questions that you really were asking

3982
01:47:28.260 --> 01:47:29.140
that are inchoate.

3983
01:47:29.360 --> 01:47:30.200
You know, you don't even know quite

3984
01:47:30.200 --> 01:47:32.100
how to put words to these questions

3985
01:47:32.100 --> 01:47:37.280
because the complex is so hard to apprehend

3986
01:47:37.280 --> 01:47:39.520
that you don't even, you can't even,

3987
01:47:39.760 --> 01:47:40.860
you don't even know the questions,

3988
01:47:41.080 --> 01:47:42.220
let alone the answers.

3989
01:47:42.460 --> 01:47:44.060
But that's what you're grappling toward.

3990
01:47:44.120 --> 01:47:46.840
And that's, I believe that's what humans

3991
01:47:46.840 --> 01:47:47.760
are grappling toward.

3992
01:47:48.140 --> 01:47:49.800
That's what Aquinas was saying,

3993
01:47:49.800 --> 01:47:51.800
that we all want the thing,

3994
01:47:52.180 --> 01:47:53.600
but we'll like, all right, I'll take

3995
01:47:53.600 --> 01:47:54.080
the substitute.

3996
01:47:54.520 --> 01:47:55.900
All right, I'll take the substitute.

3997
01:47:56.520 --> 01:47:58.840
And people start to freak out about dying

3998
01:47:58.840 --> 01:48:00.240
if they've been taking the substitute,

3999
01:48:00.380 --> 01:48:02.100
the counterfeit, money, power, pleasure, fame

4000
01:48:02.100 --> 01:48:02.680
their whole life

4001
01:48:02.680 --> 01:48:03.900
because they're running out of time

4002
01:48:03.900 --> 01:48:05.420
and they haven't made any progress

4003
01:48:05.420 --> 01:48:06.680
because they've been, you know,

4004
01:48:06.780 --> 01:48:10.780
eating non-nutritious food and not getting,

4005
01:48:11.140 --> 01:48:12.120
and they're starving to death.

4006
01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:13.940
And it's just, they get,

4007
01:48:14.040 --> 01:48:15.460
people get into a panic in their life.

4008
01:48:15.820 --> 01:48:18.260
And they realize they get into this deep,

4009
01:48:20.260 --> 01:48:21.980
existential dread, this ennui

4010
01:48:21.980 --> 01:48:23.480
that comes from, you know,

4011
01:48:23.520 --> 01:48:24.780
the depression of the world

4012
01:48:24.780 --> 01:48:26.480
that comes because there aren't any answers.

4013
01:48:26.780 --> 01:48:28.480
And maybe Nietzsche was right

4014
01:48:28.480 --> 01:48:30.760
and they were just looking in the

4015
01:48:30.760 --> 01:48:31.420
wrong place.

4016
01:48:31.920 --> 01:48:32.740
So that's what I see.

4017
01:48:32.820 --> 01:48:35.340
I mean, I'm endlessly interested

4018
01:48:35.340 --> 01:48:37.760
and enthusiastic about the promise

4019
01:48:37.760 --> 01:48:38.220
of AI,

4020
01:48:38.540 --> 01:48:40.680
but I'm not kidding myself for a second

4021
01:48:40.680 --> 01:48:41.740
to think that it's gonna answer

4022
01:48:41.740 --> 01:48:43.080
the real questions that I have

4023
01:48:43.080 --> 01:48:44.600
and that real people have.

4024
01:48:44.760 --> 01:48:47.040
And the real things that people want.

4025
01:48:47.560 --> 01:48:48.780
It's funny because, you know,

4026
01:48:49.020 --> 01:48:50.900
the one thing that we really all want,

4027
01:48:50.900 --> 01:48:52.160
we don't have the technology for,

4028
01:48:52.220 --> 01:48:53.360
and we're not getting closer to it.

4029
01:48:53.880 --> 01:48:54.980
You know, the happiness

4030
01:48:54.980 --> 01:48:56.240
that everybody really wants,

4031
01:48:56.400 --> 01:48:57.880
it's not sold on the internet.

4032
01:48:58.360 --> 01:49:00.080
It's not provided by the government.

4033
01:49:00.720 --> 01:49:02.480
You know, we've got lunar landers

4034
01:49:02.480 --> 01:49:04.580
and TikTok videos and you name it.

4035
01:49:04.740 --> 01:49:06.000
We can invent anything.

4036
01:49:06.260 --> 01:49:07.780
The ingenuity is almost boundless,

4037
01:49:07.860 --> 01:49:09.100
but we're not getting closer

4038
01:49:09.100 --> 01:49:10.200
to the thing that we want

4039
01:49:10.200 --> 01:49:12.720
because the ingenuity is being deployed

4040
01:49:12.720 --> 01:49:14.800
toward complicated ends

4041
01:49:14.800 --> 01:49:17.400
as opposed to the answers to complex problems.

4042
01:49:18.220 --> 01:49:20.580
We're answering the wrong set of questions.

4043
01:49:21.040 --> 01:49:22.160
It's what it comes down to.

4044
01:49:22.220 --> 01:49:23.800
And that's why you can find people

4045
01:49:23.800 --> 01:49:24.860
who have everything in the world

4046
01:49:24.860 --> 01:49:25.600
and are still miserable.

4047
01:49:26.680 --> 01:49:28.260
They couldn't get it there.

4048
01:49:28.380 --> 01:49:29.420
They couldn't buy what they wanted

4049
01:49:29.420 --> 01:49:30.200
in that store.

4050
01:49:30.520 --> 01:49:31.320
It's the way that it works.

4051
01:49:31.380 --> 01:49:32.180
Interesting, the Dalai Lama

4052
01:49:32.180 --> 01:49:33.780
and I had a conversation about this

4053
01:49:33.780 --> 01:49:34.780
because he and I have worked together

4054
01:49:34.780 --> 01:49:36.360
in various projects for the last 11 years.

4055
01:49:37.020 --> 01:49:38.360
And we had this conversation about it.

4056
01:49:38.380 --> 01:49:39.640
He says, you know, he's musing.

4057
01:49:39.960 --> 01:49:40.500
That's one point.

4058
01:49:40.580 --> 01:49:42.140
When the Dalai Lama muses, you listen.

4059
01:49:42.460 --> 01:49:44.160
And it's like, it's funny

4060
01:49:44.160 --> 01:49:46.940
because, you know, you Westerners,

4061
01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:48.640
you know, you've done everything

4062
01:49:48.640 --> 01:49:53.080
to create economic value

4063
01:49:53.080 --> 01:49:54.720
and tremendous businesses

4064
01:49:54.720 --> 01:49:56.640
and incredible wealth.

4065
01:49:56.920 --> 01:49:58.420
And it's so wonderful

4066
01:49:58.420 --> 01:50:00.160
to give people all this opportunity

4067
01:50:00.160 --> 01:50:01.520
so they don't starve to death.

4068
01:50:01.620 --> 01:50:02.720
And, you know, the world is richer

4069
01:50:02.720 --> 01:50:03.060
and all that.

4070
01:50:03.280 --> 01:50:05.840
But you spent no time

4071
01:50:05.840 --> 01:50:08.200
actually trying to understand the nature

4072
01:50:08.200 --> 01:50:09.580
of what really matters the most.

4073
01:50:10.640 --> 01:50:12.240
He says, we're poorer.

4074
01:50:12.820 --> 01:50:14.660
Yeah, our societies are poorer in

4075
01:50:14.660 --> 01:50:14.920
the East,

4076
01:50:14.980 --> 01:50:16.700
but we spent all our time

4077
01:50:16.700 --> 01:50:18.360
and all our ingenuity

4078
01:50:18.360 --> 01:50:20.300
trying to get the source of pure truth.

4079
01:50:21.920 --> 01:50:23.260
Did they make any more progress than

4080
01:50:23.260 --> 01:50:23.640
we did?

4081
01:50:23.720 --> 01:50:24.200
I'm not sure.

4082
01:50:24.280 --> 01:50:25.240
But also it's interesting

4083
01:50:25.240 --> 01:50:27.280
because a lot of Buddhists

4084
01:50:27.280 --> 01:50:28.760
will look at Christianity

4085
01:50:28.760 --> 01:50:30.280
and they'll be like, yeah, yeah,

4086
01:50:30.280 --> 01:50:31.340
we used to believe that 4,000

4087
01:50:31.340 --> 01:50:31.800
years ago.

4088
01:50:33.380 --> 01:50:37.000
That's a rudimentary theological technology.

4089
01:50:38.060 --> 01:50:39.020
You're on the right road,

4090
01:50:39.480 --> 01:50:41.340
but you're way, way back

4091
01:50:41.340 --> 01:50:42.320
compared to where we were.

4092
01:50:42.440 --> 01:50:43.500
Yeah, we used to have a guy.

4093
01:50:43.700 --> 01:50:44.480
Yeah, we used to have a guy,

4094
01:50:44.800 --> 01:50:45.040
you know.

4095
01:50:45.040 --> 01:50:46.180
And the whole thing,

4096
01:50:46.360 --> 01:50:47.120
as opposed to,

4097
01:50:47.260 --> 01:50:48.340
these are different religions

4098
01:50:48.340 --> 01:50:49.360
trying to get at the same ideas

4099
01:50:49.360 --> 01:50:49.880
in different ways.

4100
01:50:49.960 --> 01:50:51.340
They think there's a natural progression

4101
01:50:51.340 --> 01:50:52.480
of enlightenment

4102
01:50:52.480 --> 01:50:54.820
that happens to people and societies.

4103
01:50:55.120 --> 01:50:56.960
And we're thousands of years behind

4104
01:50:56.960 --> 01:50:57.540
where they are,

4105
01:50:57.600 --> 01:50:59.300
despite the fact that we're hundreds

4106
01:50:59.300 --> 01:51:00.060
of years ahead,

4107
01:51:00.140 --> 01:51:00.600
economically.

4108
01:51:00.920 --> 01:51:02.240
We're thousands of years behind

4109
01:51:02.240 --> 01:51:03.440
in terms of spiritual enlightenment,

4110
01:51:03.800 --> 01:51:04.960
complex versus complicated.

4111
01:51:05.440 --> 01:51:05.980
Same idea.

4112
01:51:06.500 --> 01:51:07.620
I don't know if it's true.

4113
01:51:08.940 --> 01:51:10.260
That is the question.

4114
01:51:10.720 --> 01:51:12.780
All right, let's re-ground this for

4115
01:51:12.780 --> 01:51:13.100
a second.

4116
01:51:13.220 --> 01:51:14.520
This has gotten pretty heavy, man.

4117
01:51:14.520 --> 01:51:16.660
I've never had a conversation like

4118
01:51:16.660 --> 01:51:17.160
this before.

4119
01:51:17.700 --> 01:51:18.480
Yeah, this is-

4120
01:51:18.480 --> 01:51:20.760
In media, this is amazing.

4121
01:51:21.040 --> 01:51:21.680
Oh, thank you.

4122
01:51:23.140 --> 01:51:24.500
Assuming that the audience is still

4123
01:51:24.500 --> 01:51:24.920
with us,

4124
01:51:25.720 --> 01:51:26.800
let's re-ground this.

4125
01:51:26.940 --> 01:51:28.880
So in the book, you talk about

4126
01:51:29.500 --> 01:51:31.940
what it is exactly that people need

4127
01:51:31.940 --> 01:51:33.860
to come back together.

4128
01:51:34.000 --> 01:51:35.400
So you talk about the four pillars

4129
01:51:35.400 --> 01:51:36.640
to build the life you want.

4130
01:51:36.740 --> 01:51:36.940
Right.

4131
01:51:37.720 --> 01:51:39.460
What are those four pillars?

4132
01:51:39.880 --> 01:51:41.780
And if I can contextualize this,

4133
01:51:41.780 --> 01:51:44.240
why does modern technology seem to

4134
01:51:44.240 --> 01:51:44.540
move us

4135
01:51:44.540 --> 01:51:46.280
in the exact opposite direction?

4136
01:51:46.660 --> 01:51:48.540
Yeah, so what we want is love.

4137
01:51:49.040 --> 01:51:50.120
That's what we want.

4138
01:51:50.480 --> 01:51:53.640
And once again, the world gives us

4139
01:51:53.640 --> 01:51:54.340
complicated things.

4140
01:51:54.400 --> 01:51:55.300
We want complex things.

4141
01:51:55.420 --> 01:51:56.060
Love is complex.

4142
01:51:56.740 --> 01:51:57.660
How do you get love?

4143
01:51:58.120 --> 01:52:00.920
Love of the divine or love of truth,

4144
01:52:01.320 --> 01:52:04.340
love of your family, love with friendship.

4145
01:52:05.360 --> 01:52:08.080
The point of intersection between family

4146
01:52:08.080 --> 01:52:09.320
and friendship is romantic love.

4147
01:52:09.700 --> 01:52:11.200
So that crosses both those categories.

4148
01:52:11.200 --> 01:52:13.400
And love of everybody is instantiated

4149
01:52:13.400 --> 01:52:14.800
in the way you earn your daily bread,

4150
01:52:14.920 --> 01:52:15.700
which is work.

4151
01:52:16.280 --> 01:52:18.220
So the way that we needed the portfolio,

4152
01:52:18.360 --> 01:52:20.960
the pillars or the investment portfolio

4153
01:52:20.960 --> 01:52:22.380
for happiness that we all need

4154
01:52:22.380 --> 01:52:24.340
is to spend every day thinking

4155
01:52:24.340 --> 01:52:26.220
about the way that we're going to

4156
01:52:26.220 --> 01:52:27.180
make progress

4157
01:52:27.180 --> 01:52:29.100
in our faith or philosophy,

4158
01:52:29.280 --> 01:52:30.420
whether it's religious or not,

4159
01:52:30.760 --> 01:52:32.560
family life, friendship,

4160
01:52:33.020 --> 01:52:34.560
real friends, not deal friends.

4161
01:52:35.200 --> 01:52:36.900
And the modern world gives us lots

4162
01:52:36.900 --> 01:52:37.400
of deal friends,

4163
01:52:37.460 --> 01:52:38.620
but not very many real friends,

4164
01:52:39.240 --> 01:52:40.760
which are real friends,

4165
01:52:40.760 --> 01:52:43.240
deal friends are useful to us.

4166
01:52:43.300 --> 01:52:44.320
Real friends are useless.

4167
01:52:45.520 --> 01:52:46.860
And that's why we don't spend a

4168
01:52:46.860 --> 01:52:47.440
lot of time on them.

4169
01:52:47.500 --> 01:52:49.380
And then work that serves is what

4170
01:52:49.380 --> 01:52:50.080
it comes down to.

4171
01:52:50.200 --> 01:52:51.920
So those are the silos.

4172
01:52:52.560 --> 01:52:53.580
Those are the deposits.

4173
01:52:53.840 --> 01:52:55.400
Those are the accounts that we need

4174
01:52:55.400 --> 01:52:57.420
to put investment in every single day.

4175
01:52:57.880 --> 01:52:59.020
And if we don't, we're going to

4176
01:52:59.020 --> 01:53:01.100
be missing things.

4177
01:53:01.600 --> 01:53:03.160
We're not going to be as happy

4178
01:53:03.160 --> 01:53:03.740
as we could be.

4179
01:53:03.800 --> 01:53:04.700
And we're not going to be building

4180
01:53:04.700 --> 01:53:07.840
a stable and steady happiness

4181
01:53:08.320 --> 01:53:10.280
that will improve our lives

4182
01:53:10.280 --> 01:53:11.440
and help us make progress as we

4183
01:53:11.440 --> 01:53:11.940
go through life.

4184
01:53:11.980 --> 01:53:12.800
So those are the four things.

4185
01:53:12.900 --> 01:53:14.260
It's just a very practical matter.

4186
01:53:15.120 --> 01:53:15.820
I set people on,

4187
01:53:15.900 --> 01:53:16.760
I can actually set up a course

4188
01:53:16.760 --> 01:53:17.080
of action.

4189
01:53:17.180 --> 01:53:20.620
Most people watching us are very good

4190
01:53:20.620 --> 01:53:21.100
at working.

4191
01:53:21.740 --> 01:53:22.980
You know, nobody's watching impact theory

4192
01:53:22.980 --> 01:53:23.860
who's a total slacker.

4193
01:53:24.160 --> 01:53:24.940
It's like, yeah, I don't think

4194
01:53:24.940 --> 01:53:26.240
I'm going to sit around all day,

4195
01:53:26.360 --> 01:53:27.620
but I'm going to watch impact theory.

4196
01:53:27.760 --> 01:53:29.540
No, you want to be better at

4197
01:53:29.540 --> 01:53:29.960
what you do.

4198
01:53:30.060 --> 01:53:31.400
So everybody watching us has got,

4199
01:53:31.480 --> 01:53:32.880
his work is pretty on point.

4200
01:53:33.500 --> 01:53:35.840
And okay, and it's creating value

4201
01:53:35.840 --> 01:53:37.320
and it's cool stuff.

4202
01:53:37.580 --> 01:53:38.480
Generally speaking, it's going to

4203
01:53:38.480 --> 01:53:39.120
be cool stuff.

4204
01:53:39.760 --> 01:53:41.840
You've got a cool stuff audience, good.

4205
01:53:43.060 --> 01:53:45.440
But are you working on your philosophical life?

4206
01:53:45.800 --> 01:53:46.940
Are you reading the Stoics?

4207
01:53:47.540 --> 01:53:49.400
Are you walking in nature without devices?

4208
01:53:49.660 --> 01:53:51.140
Are you studying the work of Johann

4209
01:53:51.140 --> 01:53:51.880
Sebastian Bach?

4210
01:53:52.000 --> 01:53:53.660
Are you engaged in meditation practice?

4211
01:53:53.820 --> 01:53:55.120
Are you practicing the religion of

4212
01:53:55.120 --> 01:53:55.480
your youth?

4213
01:53:56.200 --> 01:53:57.240
You need to do something like that

4214
01:53:57.240 --> 01:53:57.620
every day.

4215
01:53:58.320 --> 01:54:00.320
I recommend at least 15 minutes

4216
01:54:00.320 --> 01:54:02.080
of wisdom reading every day.

4217
01:54:02.720 --> 01:54:03.680
Stuff you don't need to read,

4218
01:54:04.280 --> 01:54:06.300
but your soul needs it.

4219
01:54:06.380 --> 01:54:07.320
15 minutes a day.

4220
01:54:07.320 --> 01:54:08.540
And I have a whole, you know,

4221
01:54:08.560 --> 01:54:09.700
list of books that I recommend.

4222
01:54:09.920 --> 01:54:10.500
Toss out a couple.

4223
01:54:10.860 --> 01:54:11.760
Well, I'll toss out a couple,

4224
01:54:12.060 --> 01:54:14.540
depending on what tradition

4225
01:54:14.540 --> 01:54:15.760
you want to start in.

4226
01:54:15.960 --> 01:54:18.460
You know, somebody who is interested

4227
01:54:18.460 --> 01:54:19.980
in all Eastern and Western

4228
01:54:19.980 --> 01:54:21.660
and very questioning and open

4229
01:54:21.660 --> 01:54:22.800
to all different ideas.

4230
01:54:22.900 --> 01:54:24.540
I would recommend The Way of a Pilgrim,

4231
01:54:24.700 --> 01:54:26.780
which is written by an anonymous

4232
01:54:26.780 --> 01:54:29.900
Russian Orthodox monk in the 19th century.

4233
01:54:30.060 --> 01:54:31.060
Way of a Pilgrim?

4234
01:54:31.140 --> 01:54:31.880
The Way of a Pilgrim.

4235
01:54:32.340 --> 01:54:34.040
And what he is, he's just walking

4236
01:54:34.040 --> 01:54:35.240
around Russia,

4237
01:54:35.240 --> 01:54:36.180
having adventures,

4238
01:54:36.420 --> 01:54:38.400
saying one prayer over and over and

4239
01:54:38.400 --> 01:54:38.920
over again.

4240
01:54:39.020 --> 01:54:39.980
It's a meditative book.

4241
01:54:40.040 --> 01:54:40.500
You're reading it.

4242
01:54:40.580 --> 01:54:41.820
It's just like the more you read,

4243
01:54:41.840 --> 01:54:43.080
it turns into a page turner.

4244
01:54:43.200 --> 01:54:44.220
It's the most boring book ever.

4245
01:54:44.260 --> 01:54:45.540
It turns into a page turner.

4246
01:54:45.960 --> 01:54:47.080
Zen and the Art of Archery,

4247
01:54:47.620 --> 01:54:49.740
which actually explains Zen

4248
01:54:49.740 --> 01:54:52.080
through the activity of archery

4249
01:54:52.080 --> 01:54:53.560
through the eyes of a Westerner.

4250
01:54:53.640 --> 01:54:54.720
So that's a very good way

4251
01:54:54.720 --> 01:54:57.780
to begin to understand Zen thinking.

4252
01:54:58.020 --> 01:55:00.120
Zen is the most I-self thing ever

4253
01:55:00.120 --> 01:55:00.800
because it's nothing more

4254
01:55:00.800 --> 01:55:02.280
than an attitude of observation.

4255
01:55:02.860 --> 01:55:03.900
That's what Zen really is.

4256
01:55:03.900 --> 01:55:05.100
It's a stripped thing

4257
01:55:05.100 --> 01:55:06.200
compared to Tibetan Buddhism.

4258
01:55:06.680 --> 01:55:07.680
All the Buddhists are going to,

4259
01:55:07.700 --> 01:55:08.720
you know, put in the comment section

4260
01:55:08.720 --> 01:55:10.160
how crazy and wrong

4261
01:55:10.160 --> 01:55:11.200
and wrongheaded I am on that.

4262
01:55:11.880 --> 01:55:12.960
I would recommend

4263
01:55:12.960 --> 01:55:15.240
The Miracle of Mindfulness by Thich

4264
01:55:15.240 --> 01:55:15.680
Nhat Hanh,

4265
01:55:16.460 --> 01:55:18.580
which talks about what is mindfulness?

4266
01:55:18.840 --> 01:55:20.620
It's being alive right now

4267
01:55:20.620 --> 01:55:22.080
and how you can actually do that.

4268
01:55:22.400 --> 01:55:24.100
And there's countless numbers of these things.

4269
01:55:24.140 --> 01:55:25.380
And there's any number that we could,

4270
01:55:25.420 --> 01:55:26.460
if you want fiction

4271
01:55:26.460 --> 01:55:27.680
that falls into this category,

4272
01:55:27.840 --> 01:55:29.460
it's Dostoevsky's Brothers Karamazov.

4273
01:55:29.800 --> 01:55:31.640
That is the most spiritual

4274
01:55:31.640 --> 01:55:32.700
and intellectually,

4275
01:55:33.040 --> 01:55:35.320
psychologically rich book I've ever read.

4276
01:55:36.180 --> 01:55:39.020
Dostoevsky is philosophy, right?

4277
01:55:39.120 --> 01:55:39.760
So it's kind of like

4278
01:55:39.760 --> 01:55:42.020
people were reading Atlas Shrugged

4279
01:55:42.020 --> 01:55:45.200
because they wanted objectivist philosophy

4280
01:55:45.200 --> 01:55:46.040
in the form of a novel.

4281
01:55:46.220 --> 01:55:50.660
If you want the essence of the search

4282
01:55:50.660 --> 01:55:51.960
for the complex oneness

4283
01:55:51.960 --> 01:55:53.680
in the form of a novel,

4284
01:55:54.060 --> 01:55:57.220
Brothers Karamazov by Fyodor Dostoevsky,

4285
01:55:57.300 --> 01:55:57.640
it's great.

4286
01:55:58.100 --> 01:55:59.040
And so there's reading.

4287
01:55:59.540 --> 01:56:00.680
Second thing is family life.

4288
01:56:00.680 --> 01:56:02.260
Again, we talked about that before.

4289
01:56:02.400 --> 01:56:04.740
There's one reason to have schism

4290
01:56:04.740 --> 01:56:05.180
in your family,

4291
01:56:05.260 --> 01:56:05.840
and that's abuse.

4292
01:56:06.120 --> 01:56:07.480
Everything else requires work.

4293
01:56:07.840 --> 01:56:09.820
The big reason that people drift away

4294
01:56:09.820 --> 01:56:10.380
from their families

4295
01:56:10.380 --> 01:56:12.820
is because they're just lazy.

4296
01:56:13.420 --> 01:56:14.380
They're just lazy.

4297
01:56:14.660 --> 01:56:15.100
They're just like,

4298
01:56:15.160 --> 01:56:16.180
I ain't got to call mom.

4299
01:56:16.280 --> 01:56:17.500
When was the last time I saw mom?

4300
01:56:18.120 --> 01:56:18.940
Do the work.

4301
01:56:19.060 --> 01:56:20.000
But it takes two to tango.

4302
01:56:20.160 --> 01:56:22.880
Like if the person is just not investing,

4303
01:56:23.060 --> 01:56:24.860
like you're trying to engage with

4304
01:56:24.860 --> 01:56:25.240
your mom

4305
01:56:25.240 --> 01:56:26.120
and oh my God.

4306
01:56:26.320 --> 01:56:26.740
Yeah, I know.

4307
01:56:26.840 --> 01:56:29.380
But the point is that generally speaking,

4308
01:56:29.380 --> 01:56:30.560
it's an iterative process

4309
01:56:30.560 --> 01:56:31.880
where you don't and she doesn't

4310
01:56:31.880 --> 01:56:32.980
and you don't and she doesn't

4311
01:56:32.980 --> 01:56:33.960
and you don't and she doesn't.

4312
01:56:34.040 --> 01:56:35.040
It's got to get restarted.

4313
01:56:35.720 --> 01:56:36.540
And doing the work,

4314
01:56:36.620 --> 01:56:39.740
actually, even unilateral work,

4315
01:56:39.780 --> 01:56:40.980
even one-sided work

4316
01:56:40.980 --> 01:56:42.860
is incredibly enriching for your happiness.

4317
01:56:43.260 --> 01:56:45.360
Because the part about relationships

4318
01:56:45.360 --> 01:56:46.220
that's best

4319
01:56:46.220 --> 01:56:46.820
is the giving.

4320
01:56:47.380 --> 01:56:48.200
It's not the getting.

4321
01:56:48.600 --> 01:56:50.160
It's better if you're giving and getting.

4322
01:56:50.300 --> 01:56:50.780
I get it.

4323
01:56:50.880 --> 01:56:51.780
I mean, there's an equation.

4324
01:56:52.040 --> 01:56:53.420
It's a dynamic situation.

4325
01:56:53.600 --> 01:56:54.480
But even if you don't,

4326
01:56:54.520 --> 01:56:55.480
it's better to do it than not

4327
01:56:55.480 --> 01:56:55.840
to do it.

4328
01:56:56.320 --> 01:56:57.580
Friendship is critically important.

4329
01:56:57.580 --> 01:56:59.160
Real friends, not deal friends.

4330
01:56:59.540 --> 01:57:02.060
And that means the work that you

4331
01:57:02.060 --> 01:57:02.820
have to do

4332
01:57:02.820 --> 01:57:04.680
is not pecuniary.

4333
01:57:04.940 --> 01:57:06.140
I have people I work with who

4334
01:57:06.140 --> 01:57:06.840
are real friends,

4335
01:57:07.340 --> 01:57:08.720
but they started as real friends

4336
01:57:08.720 --> 01:57:09.760
and we just look for an excuse

4337
01:57:09.760 --> 01:57:10.700
to spend more time together

4338
01:57:10.700 --> 01:57:12.140
and that's how they became deal friends too.

4339
01:57:12.800 --> 01:57:13.780
But the whole point is,

4340
01:57:13.860 --> 01:57:15.100
you know, the people that you grew

4341
01:57:15.100 --> 01:57:15.420
up with,

4342
01:57:15.520 --> 01:57:17.260
often people they went to college with

4343
01:57:17.260 --> 01:57:18.540
if they went to college.

4344
01:57:19.280 --> 01:57:20.220
And, you know, I have a son

4345
01:57:20.220 --> 01:57:20.640
in the military

4346
01:57:20.640 --> 01:57:22.100
and his buddy's in the military.

4347
01:57:22.280 --> 01:57:23.020
They're his real friends.

4348
01:57:23.400 --> 01:57:24.900
I mean, they've literally saved his life.

4349
01:57:25.960 --> 01:57:28.860
And he can't lose touch with those people.

4350
01:57:29.680 --> 01:57:31.140
I guess that's the ultimate deal, right?

4351
01:57:32.240 --> 01:57:33.660
In saving your life.

4352
01:57:33.900 --> 01:57:35.280
And then last but not least,

4353
01:57:35.360 --> 01:57:36.980
making sure that your work serves others

4354
01:57:36.980 --> 01:57:38.240
and you earn your success.

4355
01:57:39.040 --> 01:57:40.500
And that you're working to make sure

4356
01:57:40.500 --> 01:57:42.640
if you're an entrepreneur or a CEO

4357
01:57:42.640 --> 01:57:43.540
like you or me,

4358
01:57:44.300 --> 01:57:45.860
that the people who work for you

4359
01:57:45.860 --> 01:57:47.580
can earn their success and serve others.

4360
01:57:48.220 --> 01:57:49.560
Because they deserve to earn their success

4361
01:57:49.560 --> 01:57:50.300
and serve others.

4362
01:57:50.660 --> 01:57:51.820
And that's in the hands of the boss

4363
01:57:51.820 --> 01:57:52.780
to a very large extent.

4364
01:57:53.300 --> 01:57:54.880
That's the portfolio.

4365
01:57:55.700 --> 01:57:57.280
And either you're doing those things

4366
01:57:57.280 --> 01:57:57.560
every day

4367
01:57:57.560 --> 01:57:58.220
or you're not.

4368
01:57:58.740 --> 01:57:59.980
Either you did your reading

4369
01:57:59.980 --> 01:58:03.000
and called mom and your best friend

4370
01:58:03.000 --> 01:58:04.920
or you didn't, right?

4371
01:58:04.960 --> 01:58:06.060
And every day that you don't,

4372
01:58:06.180 --> 01:58:08.940
you're just, you're weakening the pillars

4373
01:58:08.940 --> 01:58:09.640
of your happiness.

4374
01:58:09.900 --> 01:58:13.360
You're getting less competent

4375
01:58:13.360 --> 01:58:15.000
in the serious business of building

4376
01:58:15.000 --> 01:58:15.400
your life.

4377
01:58:16.960 --> 01:58:18.380
I think you may have even said

4378
01:58:18.380 --> 01:58:19.220
it in this episode,

4379
01:58:19.340 --> 01:58:21.880
but life is an entrepreneurial game.

4380
01:58:21.880 --> 01:58:22.420
It's a startup.

4381
01:58:22.900 --> 01:58:27.320
So when I think about those different pillars,

4382
01:58:28.400 --> 01:58:29.980
they're not necessarily,

4383
01:58:30.320 --> 01:58:32.860
like they don't seem like big, scary things.

4384
01:58:34.240 --> 01:58:36.160
So how do we approach those

4385
01:58:36.160 --> 01:58:38.000
from an entrepreneurial standpoint?

4386
01:58:38.160 --> 01:58:40.540
Like how do we make these more

4387
01:58:40.540 --> 01:58:41.000
than just,

4388
01:58:41.120 --> 01:58:42.440
oh, I checked in with my friend.

4389
01:58:42.620 --> 01:58:44.420
I touched base with mom.

4390
01:58:44.560 --> 01:58:45.920
I read a passage in the Bible.

4391
01:58:45.920 --> 01:58:47.720
Like how do we go beyond going

4392
01:58:47.720 --> 01:58:48.300
through the motions

4393
01:58:48.300 --> 01:58:51.360
and really do something meaningful?

4394
01:58:51.360 --> 01:58:53.260
Yeah, well, to be more entrepreneurial

4395
01:58:53.260 --> 01:58:53.820
about it,

4396
01:58:53.840 --> 01:58:56.140
you have to actually induce risk.

4397
01:58:56.520 --> 01:58:58.760
You have to inject risk into the proposition.

4398
01:58:59.540 --> 01:59:01.620
So one of the things about willingness

4399
01:59:01.620 --> 01:59:04.120
and ability to take risk for outsized return,

4400
01:59:04.620 --> 01:59:05.840
you can tell I've written a textbook

4401
01:59:05.840 --> 01:59:07.120
on entrepreneurship and it's like,

4402
01:59:07.180 --> 01:59:08.360
this is what they all have in common

4403
01:59:08.360 --> 01:59:09.680
is this willingness and ability to

4404
01:59:09.680 --> 01:59:10.120
take risk

4405
01:59:10.120 --> 01:59:12.980
in exchange for outsized returns.

4406
01:59:13.460 --> 01:59:14.460
Now, usually for entrepreneurs,

4407
01:59:14.600 --> 01:59:15.760
the way they'll denominate it

4408
01:59:15.760 --> 01:59:16.860
is green pieces of paper.

4409
01:59:17.380 --> 01:59:18.680
But the truth is for the startup

4410
01:59:18.680 --> 01:59:19.240
of your life,

4411
01:59:19.320 --> 01:59:21.040
it's usually the denomination is love.

4412
01:59:21.540 --> 01:59:23.820
Is you're willing to take risk for love.

4413
01:59:24.480 --> 01:59:26.620
You said either in the book or

4414
01:59:26.620 --> 01:59:26.940
the interview,

4415
01:59:27.140 --> 01:59:28.880
I wouldn't invest in an entrepreneur

4416
01:59:28.880 --> 01:59:30.140
that was afraid to fall in love.

4417
01:59:30.160 --> 01:59:30.880
That's exactly right.

4418
01:59:30.940 --> 01:59:32.300
So that's one of the greatest examples

4419
01:59:32.300 --> 01:59:33.140
for a lot of people who are

4420
01:59:33.140 --> 01:59:33.720
watching us.

4421
01:59:34.700 --> 01:59:35.440
Disproportionately, people who are

4422
01:59:35.440 --> 01:59:35.820
watching us

4423
01:59:35.820 --> 01:59:36.960
are gonna be people in their 20s,

4424
01:59:36.980 --> 01:59:38.500
a lot of guys in their 20s,

4425
01:59:38.600 --> 01:59:39.440
the audience.

4426
01:59:39.960 --> 01:59:41.780
Unless I dreadfully misperceived the audience.

4427
01:59:41.940 --> 01:59:42.820
No, no, you're close, yeah.

4428
01:59:43.780 --> 01:59:45.500
And I know a lot of guys,

4429
01:59:45.600 --> 01:59:46.020
my students,

4430
01:59:46.120 --> 01:59:47.280
my graduate students at Harvard

4431
01:59:47.280 --> 01:59:48.920
who are willing to put $10 million

4432
01:59:48.920 --> 01:59:50.700
of other people's capital at risk

4433
01:59:50.700 --> 01:59:52.480
or even their own if they've got it.

4434
01:59:52.860 --> 01:59:55.420
They're willing to take a big scary job,

4435
01:59:55.500 --> 01:59:56.780
but they're not willing to ask a

4436
01:59:56.780 --> 01:59:57.620
girl out on a date.

4437
01:59:58.380 --> 01:59:59.100
Like what?

4438
01:59:59.720 --> 02:00:02.400
And the answer is to that conundrum,

4439
02:00:02.480 --> 02:00:03.660
to that mystery, that riddle

4440
02:00:03.660 --> 02:00:05.360
is that they're not entrepreneurial

4441
02:00:05.860 --> 02:00:07.000
in the part of the life that

4442
02:00:07.000 --> 02:00:07.760
matters the most,

4443
02:00:07.820 --> 02:00:08.840
which is their heart.

4444
02:00:09.880 --> 02:00:10.640
You know, this is like,

4445
02:00:10.700 --> 02:00:11.740
if you're willing to put money at risk,

4446
02:00:11.760 --> 02:00:13.520
but not love at risk and self

4447
02:00:13.520 --> 02:00:14.920
-esteem at risk,

4448
02:00:15.040 --> 02:00:16.160
you're not an entrepreneur

4449
02:00:16.160 --> 02:00:17.500
and you're not gonna have an exciting life.

4450
02:00:17.960 --> 02:00:18.520
You're just not.

4451
02:00:19.260 --> 02:00:20.380
And here's the interesting thing.

4452
02:00:20.380 --> 02:00:22.720
I had this, I was talking to

4453
02:00:22.720 --> 02:00:23.060
this guy.

4454
02:00:24.500 --> 02:00:25.200
Here's how it worked.

4455
02:00:25.240 --> 02:00:26.280
I was giving a talk and I

4456
02:00:26.280 --> 02:00:27.880
gave the analogy

4457
02:00:27.880 --> 02:00:29.760
of entrepreneurship in the business

4458
02:00:29.760 --> 02:00:30.820
of romantic love.

4459
02:00:31.740 --> 02:00:34.320
And I said, I gave him a,

4460
02:00:34.420 --> 02:00:35.680
it was a group of, a big

4461
02:00:35.680 --> 02:00:37.280
group of 20 somethings

4462
02:00:37.280 --> 02:00:38.080
in Washington, DC.

4463
02:00:38.380 --> 02:00:39.920
And I remember the day distinctly.

4464
02:00:40.280 --> 02:00:42.080
And I said, here's your assignment.

4465
02:00:42.200 --> 02:00:43.900
You got two weeks to tell somebody

4466
02:00:43.900 --> 02:00:45.420
you love that person

4467
02:00:45.420 --> 02:00:47.020
who doesn't know it.

4468
02:00:47.480 --> 02:00:49.320
And if it's not scary,

4469
02:00:49.480 --> 02:00:50.520
it's not the right person.

4470
02:00:51.140 --> 02:00:53.000
And maybe, by the way, maybe it's

4471
02:00:53.000 --> 02:00:53.380
your dad.

4472
02:00:53.820 --> 02:00:54.340
Maybe it's your dad.

4473
02:00:54.960 --> 02:00:56.760
Unfortunately, I love my dad to death.

4474
02:00:56.820 --> 02:00:57.140
Yeah, I know.

4475
02:00:57.280 --> 02:00:58.160
It sounds easy.

4476
02:00:58.520 --> 02:00:58.720
Yeah, yeah.

4477
02:00:58.780 --> 02:00:59.900
But for a lot of people,

4478
02:00:59.920 --> 02:01:01.320
they have relationships with their families.

4479
02:01:01.500 --> 02:01:03.180
Like, I've never told you this, but

4480
02:01:03.180 --> 02:01:03.700
I love you.

4481
02:01:03.800 --> 02:01:06.480
And that's like scary and weird and

4482
02:01:06.480 --> 02:01:08.200
awkward and et cetera.

4483
02:01:08.280 --> 02:01:09.380
So it doesn't have to be a

4484
02:01:09.380 --> 02:01:10.440
romantic love.

4485
02:01:11.040 --> 02:01:12.440
But the whole point is,

4486
02:01:12.500 --> 02:01:14.360
if it's not scary, it's not entrepreneurial enough.

4487
02:01:14.460 --> 02:01:14.560
Okay.

4488
02:01:14.560 --> 02:01:17.740
So this kid, kid in his twenties,

4489
02:01:19.280 --> 02:01:21.200
finds me on an airplane a couple

4490
02:01:21.200 --> 02:01:21.640
of weeks later.

4491
02:01:21.680 --> 02:01:22.880
He says, I was at that speech

4492
02:01:22.880 --> 02:01:23.640
in Washington, DC

4493
02:01:24.520 --> 02:01:25.540
and I can't get it out of

4494
02:01:25.540 --> 02:01:25.940
my head.

4495
02:01:26.020 --> 02:01:26.400
And I'm like, yeah.

4496
02:01:26.920 --> 02:01:28.740
He says, so I'm literally on my

4497
02:01:28.740 --> 02:01:30.200
way right now to Philadelphia

4498
02:01:31.260 --> 02:01:32.820
to confess my love to a woman

4499
02:01:32.820 --> 02:01:33.800
I've been secretly in love with

4500
02:01:33.800 --> 02:01:34.380
for two weeks.

4501
02:01:34.640 --> 02:01:34.960
Wow.

4502
02:01:35.180 --> 02:01:35.880
For two months.

4503
02:01:36.040 --> 02:01:37.320
No, two years, two years.

4504
02:01:37.380 --> 02:01:38.160
I've been in love with this woman.

4505
02:01:38.220 --> 02:01:39.520
I've never told her because I'm too afraid.

4506
02:01:39.660 --> 02:01:40.920
And I'm going there right now because

4507
02:01:40.920 --> 02:01:41.360
of your speech.

4508
02:01:41.420 --> 02:01:43.560
And I'm like, it's only a speech, man.

4509
02:01:43.960 --> 02:01:44.660
Bro, be careful.

4510
02:01:44.920 --> 02:01:46.560
I don't want to ruin his life.

4511
02:01:47.280 --> 02:01:47.940
And I said-

4512
02:01:47.940 --> 02:01:49.220
Did you get a follow-up on this?

4513
02:01:49.380 --> 02:01:49.600
I did.

4514
02:01:49.680 --> 02:01:49.880
Okay.

4515
02:01:50.040 --> 02:01:51.580
Because now I'm already engaged.

4516
02:01:51.760 --> 02:01:52.460
I did, I know.

4517
02:01:53.700 --> 02:01:54.760
But not immediately.

4518
02:01:55.360 --> 02:01:56.820
I gave him my email and I

4519
02:01:56.820 --> 02:01:58.440
said a prayer for him and the girl.

4520
02:01:59.380 --> 02:01:59.880
And I said-

4521
02:01:59.880 --> 02:02:00.040
And the girl.

4522
02:02:00.220 --> 02:02:01.720
And yeah, I said, let me know.

4523
02:02:01.800 --> 02:02:02.680
And then I didn't hear from him.

4524
02:02:02.700 --> 02:02:03.480
So I thought that was a bad sign.

4525
02:02:03.560 --> 02:02:05.000
I run into him at a holiday

4526
02:02:05.000 --> 02:02:06.500
party a few months later.

4527
02:02:06.920 --> 02:02:07.800
And I say, remember me?

4528
02:02:07.840 --> 02:02:08.320
He's like, yep.

4529
02:02:09.260 --> 02:02:10.300
And I said, how did it go?

4530
02:02:10.360 --> 02:02:11.660
And she said, she shot me down.

4531
02:02:12.320 --> 02:02:13.800
And she introduced me to the man

4532
02:02:13.800 --> 02:02:14.700
she was in love with.

4533
02:02:14.820 --> 02:02:15.640
And it was awful.

4534
02:02:15.900 --> 02:02:16.620
It was awful.

4535
02:02:16.780 --> 02:02:17.800
I said, I was very contrite.

4536
02:02:17.940 --> 02:02:18.540
I said, I'm sorry.

4537
02:02:18.880 --> 02:02:20.000
I didn't mean to mess you up,

4538
02:02:20.020 --> 02:02:20.560
you know, the whole thing.

4539
02:02:20.620 --> 02:02:21.240
He says, no, you understand.

4540
02:02:21.740 --> 02:02:23.200
I've been meaning to email you to

4541
02:02:23.200 --> 02:02:23.760
thank you.

4542
02:02:23.860 --> 02:02:24.940
I said, why?

4543
02:02:25.340 --> 02:02:26.840
He said, because that was the thing

4544
02:02:26.840 --> 02:02:28.780
I was most afraid of in my life.

4545
02:02:28.900 --> 02:02:29.680
And it happened.

4546
02:02:29.900 --> 02:02:31.200
And I didn't die.

4547
02:02:31.380 --> 02:02:33.180
And I'm never going to be afraid again.

4548
02:02:33.360 --> 02:02:33.640
Wow.

4549
02:02:34.380 --> 02:02:35.200
How did you get-

4550
02:02:35.200 --> 02:02:36.080
He's also not going to waste time

4551
02:02:36.080 --> 02:02:36.400
on her.

4552
02:02:36.680 --> 02:02:40.880
How, I mean, you're a very successful entrepreneur.

4553
02:02:41.380 --> 02:02:42.940
Not on your first venture.

4554
02:02:44.040 --> 02:02:45.980
You know, I don't, you need it.

4555
02:02:46.100 --> 02:02:47.860
It's like the, there's work out of

4556
02:02:47.860 --> 02:02:50.640
Northwestern, Kellogg, the, you know,

4557
02:02:50.680 --> 02:02:52.300
the management school in Northwestern.

4558
02:02:52.400 --> 02:02:53.440
It's a, you know, Lester University.

4559
02:02:54.040 --> 02:02:56.420
And they, the work shows that the

4560
02:02:56.420 --> 02:02:59.480
average entrepreneur has about four failures

4561
02:03:00.160 --> 02:03:01.540
before their first success.

4562
02:03:01.540 --> 02:03:03.120
And they learn from each one of

4563
02:03:03.120 --> 02:03:03.660
these failures.

4564
02:03:03.900 --> 02:03:05.860
And that's the basis of the success.

4565
02:03:05.860 --> 02:03:08.600
You need to have at least four

4566
02:03:08.600 --> 02:03:11.680
substantial heartbreaking rejections.

4567
02:03:12.780 --> 02:03:15.180
I mean, on average, if that, if

4568
02:03:15.180 --> 02:03:17.780
startup data or any indication of

4569
02:03:17.780 --> 02:03:18.660
the startup of life,

4570
02:03:19.460 --> 02:03:21.560
and that's an entrepreneurial life,

4571
02:03:21.660 --> 02:03:23.060
man, put your heart on the line,

4572
02:03:23.240 --> 02:03:24.160
get it stomped on,

4573
02:03:24.460 --> 02:03:25.060
get rejected.

4574
02:03:25.460 --> 02:03:26.260
You need it.

4575
02:03:26.400 --> 02:03:27.220
You need to learn.

4576
02:03:27.400 --> 02:03:28.120
It's what it comes down to.

4577
02:03:28.160 --> 02:03:29.760
And by the way, life is more

4578
02:03:29.760 --> 02:03:32.140
exciting when it actually does work out.

4579
02:03:32.980 --> 02:03:34.220
If you took a risk?

4580
02:03:34.220 --> 02:03:35.980
If you took a risk and you've

4581
02:03:35.980 --> 02:03:36.700
failed in the past.

4582
02:03:37.520 --> 02:03:39.240
You know, it's like, it's not that good.

4583
02:03:39.240 --> 02:03:40.580
If you didn't take a risk and

4584
02:03:40.580 --> 02:03:42.340
got rich and you never tried anything

4585
02:03:42.340 --> 02:03:43.180
hard before that,

4586
02:03:43.260 --> 02:03:44.000
that didn't work.

4587
02:03:44.840 --> 02:03:46.440
You know, part of the process is

4588
02:03:46.440 --> 02:03:47.140
the adventure.

4589
02:03:47.740 --> 02:03:49.720
And part of the adventure is the pain.

4590
02:03:50.680 --> 02:03:51.400
That's life.

4591
02:03:51.860 --> 02:03:53.340
And we need to understand that and

4592
02:03:53.340 --> 02:03:55.020
love, which is the way, way, way

4593
02:03:55.020 --> 02:03:55.940
more important than business.

4594
02:03:57.040 --> 02:03:57.780
That's well said.

4595
02:03:57.880 --> 02:03:58.000
Yeah.

4596
02:03:58.060 --> 02:04:00.620
I think a lot of people these days.

4597
02:04:00.620 --> 02:04:02.460
So going back to the framing of

4598
02:04:02.460 --> 02:04:03.800
the question where you've got modern

4599
02:04:03.800 --> 02:04:05.060
technology is pulling

4600
02:04:05.060 --> 02:04:05.580
us away.

4601
02:04:05.720 --> 02:04:07.680
You've got the celebration of business.

4602
02:04:07.680 --> 02:04:10.040
You've got money, money, money as

4603
02:04:10.040 --> 02:04:11.180
a metric of success.

4604
02:04:11.220 --> 02:04:12.740
And the thing I try to convince

4605
02:04:12.740 --> 02:04:14.300
everybody is, look, somebody that's

4606
02:04:14.300 --> 02:04:15.800
had the kind of

4607
02:04:15.800 --> 02:04:17.800
success that most people only dream of.

4608
02:04:19.000 --> 02:04:20.980
Nothing has come close to giving me

4609
02:04:20.980 --> 02:04:23.420
as much joy, fulfillment, anything,

4610
02:04:23.660 --> 02:04:24.160
protection from

4611
02:04:24.160 --> 02:04:25.740
the downside, all of it, other than

4612
02:04:25.740 --> 02:04:26.360
my marriage.

4613
02:04:26.920 --> 02:04:28.540
My marriage is the thing that I

4614
02:04:28.540 --> 02:04:29.500
protect most fiercely.

4615
02:04:29.500 --> 02:04:31.780
I am not worried about losing my money.

4616
02:04:31.920 --> 02:04:34.660
I'm not worried about losing accolades.

4617
02:04:34.800 --> 02:04:37.060
I am terrified of losing my wife.

4618
02:04:37.740 --> 02:04:37.820
Yeah.

4619
02:04:37.880 --> 02:04:39.820
And the market can have a horrible

4620
02:04:39.820 --> 02:04:40.860
day and you don't like it, but

4621
02:04:40.860 --> 02:04:41.700
your wife is really

4622
02:04:41.700 --> 02:04:43.920
mad at you and you're bummed.

4623
02:04:44.180 --> 02:04:44.460
Yeah.

4624
02:04:44.740 --> 02:04:46.460
Even if you know she's not going

4625
02:04:46.460 --> 02:04:48.380
to divorce you, you're bummed because

4626
02:04:48.380 --> 02:04:49.220
you don't want

4627
02:04:49.220 --> 02:04:51.280
the person you love the most to

4628
02:04:51.280 --> 02:04:52.820
be upset with you.

4629
02:04:52.900 --> 02:04:54.660
You want her to be happy with you.

4630
02:04:54.800 --> 02:04:56.320
Because what's happened, it's basically

4631
02:04:56.320 --> 02:04:58.860
like your stock market radically tanking.

4632
02:04:58.860 --> 02:05:00.560
The stock market of what really matters

4633
02:05:00.560 --> 02:05:01.660
in your life is the way that

4634
02:05:01.660 --> 02:05:02.220
that works out.

4635
02:05:02.300 --> 02:05:03.180
It's actually a really interesting

4636
02:05:03.180 --> 02:05:03.960
way to think about it.

4637
02:05:04.340 --> 02:05:04.500
Okay.

4638
02:05:04.600 --> 02:05:06.860
So if that is the thing, if

4639
02:05:06.860 --> 02:05:09.160
that's the thing that's going to really,

4640
02:05:09.660 --> 02:05:10.200
the thing that we're

4641
02:05:10.200 --> 02:05:11.300
pursuing is love in a bunch of

4642
02:05:11.300 --> 02:05:13.280
different guises, but the relationship

4643
02:05:13.280 --> 02:05:13.640
that's going

4644
02:05:13.640 --> 02:05:15.080
to be most important to us is

4645
02:05:15.080 --> 02:05:16.280
the relationship with our spouse.

4646
02:05:16.640 --> 02:05:17.640
How do we do that?

4647
02:05:18.180 --> 02:05:19.700
Well, and let's start at the beginning.

4648
02:05:19.760 --> 02:05:21.300
So one thing you've said is delete

4649
02:05:21.300 --> 02:05:22.040
your dating apps.

4650
02:05:22.220 --> 02:05:22.480
Yeah.

4651
02:05:23.660 --> 02:05:25.960
Or there are some people who wind

4652
02:05:25.960 --> 02:05:27.240
up meeting their partner and getting

4653
02:05:27.240 --> 02:05:28.160
married based on

4654
02:05:28.160 --> 02:05:29.680
dating apps, but dating apps, the

4655
02:05:29.680 --> 02:05:31.220
evidence suggests that it's making

4656
02:05:31.220 --> 02:05:32.120
dating harder.

4657
02:05:32.640 --> 02:05:34.900
It's actually true because it's making

4658
02:05:34.900 --> 02:05:36.800
it harder to find somebody with you,

4659
02:05:36.980 --> 02:05:37.300
with whom

4660
02:05:37.300 --> 02:05:39.360
you can have the complex connection.

4661
02:05:40.160 --> 02:05:41.420
That's appropriate for a couple of

4662
02:05:41.420 --> 02:05:41.820
different reasons.

4663
02:05:41.900 --> 02:05:43.340
Number one is the paradox of choice.

4664
02:05:43.680 --> 02:05:45.780
So dating apps give you too much choice.

4665
02:05:45.920 --> 02:05:47.580
And so what that means is that

4666
02:05:47.580 --> 02:05:48.640
there's always something better.

4667
02:05:48.840 --> 02:05:49.640
So are you saying settle?

4668
02:05:50.260 --> 02:05:50.700
Yeah.

4669
02:05:51.220 --> 02:05:51.640
Yeah.

4670
02:05:51.740 --> 02:05:52.680
Well, part of the reason is because

4671
02:05:52.680 --> 02:05:54.700
you're not going to find the perfect person.

4672
02:05:54.700 --> 02:05:56.700
You're going to make the perfect relationship.

4673
02:05:56.700 --> 02:05:57.360
Oof.

4674
02:05:58.000 --> 02:06:00.180
That's the way relationships really work.

4675
02:06:00.320 --> 02:06:01.160
You know, people think I'm going to

4676
02:06:01.160 --> 02:06:04.120
find, I mean, magical thinking is

4677
02:06:04.120 --> 02:06:04.880
a huge problem.

4678
02:06:05.440 --> 02:06:06.800
Love at first sight doesn't exist

4679
02:06:06.800 --> 02:06:08.120
and soulmates don't exist.

4680
02:06:08.420 --> 02:06:08.440
Facts.

4681
02:06:08.620 --> 02:06:08.800
Right?

4682
02:06:08.920 --> 02:06:10.360
I mean, I believe that God wants

4683
02:06:10.360 --> 02:06:11.380
me to be with my wife, but

4684
02:06:11.380 --> 02:06:12.220
that's an entirely different

4685
02:06:12.220 --> 02:06:13.460
thing than saying that there was this,

4686
02:06:13.820 --> 02:06:15.300
there was one woman in the world

4687
02:06:15.300 --> 02:06:15.820
and she lived

4688
02:06:15.820 --> 02:06:16.960
in Barcelona and she was a little

4689
02:06:16.960 --> 02:06:17.880
girl and I was growing up in

4690
02:06:17.880 --> 02:06:18.500
Seattle and the whole,

4691
02:06:18.560 --> 02:06:18.880
no, no, no.

4692
02:06:20.100 --> 02:06:21.640
Circumstances were such that I met

4693
02:06:21.640 --> 02:06:23.800
the person that was going, one of

4694
02:06:23.800 --> 02:06:24.900
the people that could

4695
02:06:24.900 --> 02:06:27.560
have been perfect for me if I

4696
02:06:27.560 --> 02:06:28.500
worked to make it perfect.

4697
02:06:28.720 --> 02:06:30.020
And your wife is cool with that framing?

4698
02:06:30.260 --> 02:06:31.780
Yeah, because she knows that that's

4699
02:06:31.780 --> 02:06:32.780
what God wants us to do.

4700
02:06:32.920 --> 02:06:34.180
You know, we believe that this is

4701
02:06:34.180 --> 02:06:35.260
what God wants us to do.

4702
02:06:35.380 --> 02:06:37.120
God puts people together and then

4703
02:06:37.120 --> 02:06:38.720
puts a lot in our hands.

4704
02:06:39.260 --> 02:06:41.200
We have free will and we have

4705
02:06:41.200 --> 02:06:42.320
to, you know, a part of making

4706
02:06:42.320 --> 02:06:44.600
cosmic love-based progress

4707
02:06:45.060 --> 02:06:46.620
is the things that we do in

4708
02:06:46.620 --> 02:06:47.260
our relationship.

4709
02:06:47.480 --> 02:06:48.600
This is the way that we work

4710
02:06:48.600 --> 02:06:51.560
out the stuff of love in life

4711
02:06:51.560 --> 02:06:53.940
is not, it's all perfect.

4712
02:06:53.940 --> 02:06:55.240
Then you're in heaven automatically.

4713
02:06:55.840 --> 02:06:56.480
Well, boring.

4714
02:06:56.640 --> 02:06:57.200
That's boring.

4715
02:06:57.480 --> 02:06:57.780
No, no, no.

4716
02:06:58.240 --> 02:06:58.940
Progress, man.

4717
02:06:59.160 --> 02:06:59.820
And you got to make progress.

4718
02:06:59.860 --> 02:07:00.740
One of the ways you make progress

4719
02:07:00.740 --> 02:07:02.500
is the imperfect that you make as

4720
02:07:02.500 --> 02:07:03.660
perfect as you can using

4721
02:07:03.660 --> 02:07:04.940
your imperfect tools.

4722
02:07:05.660 --> 02:07:07.580
And that's the exciting adventure

4723
02:07:07.580 --> 02:07:09.460
that is a romantic relationship.

4724
02:07:09.780 --> 02:07:11.660
And if you start off with the

4725
02:07:11.660 --> 02:07:12.580
idea that there's always something

4726
02:07:12.580 --> 02:07:13.640
better because of magical

4727
02:07:13.640 --> 02:07:14.940
thinking, and I'm going to find the

4728
02:07:14.940 --> 02:07:16.740
perfect one if I keep swiping right

4729
02:07:16.740 --> 02:07:17.780
or left or whatever

4730
02:07:17.780 --> 02:07:18.040
it is.

4731
02:07:18.080 --> 02:07:18.980
What is it, left or right?

4732
02:07:19.060 --> 02:07:19.520
I don't know.

4733
02:07:19.580 --> 02:07:20.120
I've never used them.

4734
02:07:20.140 --> 02:07:20.420
That's right.

4735
02:07:20.440 --> 02:07:21.440
Because you and I have been married

4736
02:07:21.440 --> 02:07:22.320
men for a long time.

4737
02:07:23.180 --> 02:07:24.140
I'm 21.

4738
02:07:24.300 --> 02:07:25.020
You're how many years?

4739
02:07:25.140 --> 02:07:25.440
32.

4740
02:07:25.780 --> 02:07:26.560
Man, it's impressive.

4741
02:07:26.680 --> 02:07:27.320
32, yeah.

4742
02:07:27.380 --> 02:07:27.760
Congratulations.

4743
02:07:28.080 --> 02:07:29.920
I am in awe of that.

4744
02:07:30.000 --> 02:07:32.980
My wife's like, it's like 10 minutes underwater.

4745
02:07:34.840 --> 02:07:35.560
That's good.

4746
02:07:35.880 --> 02:07:37.380
It's like being married to an old

4747
02:07:37.380 --> 02:07:38.900
time comedian from the Catskills.

4748
02:07:39.100 --> 02:07:39.780
It's nice.

4749
02:07:39.940 --> 02:07:41.420
Except she's Spanish.

4750
02:07:42.640 --> 02:07:43.920
Spanish Jackie Mason.

4751
02:07:44.720 --> 02:07:46.360
It's a good reference that no one

4752
02:07:46.360 --> 02:07:47.700
in the audience got, but that's okay.

4753
02:07:48.120 --> 02:07:48.620
Google him.

4754
02:07:48.860 --> 02:07:51.200
Anyway, so he's probably on YouTube.

4755
02:07:51.660 --> 02:07:52.100
Yeah.

4756
02:07:52.560 --> 02:07:53.340
Black and white.

4757
02:07:53.520 --> 02:07:53.800
Maybe.

4758
02:07:54.060 --> 02:07:54.220
Yeah.

4759
02:07:54.460 --> 02:07:54.820
Yes.

4760
02:07:54.960 --> 02:07:55.300
Jesus.

4761
02:07:55.620 --> 02:07:56.440
So that's number one.

4762
02:07:56.620 --> 02:07:58.620
The second reason, however, is that,

4763
02:07:58.840 --> 02:08:00.480
and again, I'm not down on dating apps.

4764
02:08:00.520 --> 02:08:01.580
I'm just not, I'm not down.

4765
02:08:01.620 --> 02:08:03.420
I'm not down with how people use

4766
02:08:03.420 --> 02:08:04.040
them typically.

4767
02:08:04.400 --> 02:08:04.720
Interesting.

4768
02:08:04.720 --> 02:08:05.520
People use them for-

4769
02:08:05.520 --> 02:08:06.460
This feels like you're caveating.

4770
02:08:06.860 --> 02:08:08.540
I am caveating for sure, because there's

4771
02:08:08.540 --> 02:08:10.380
nothing that's good or bad, but that-

4772
02:08:10.380 --> 02:08:11.140
Thinking makes it so.

4773
02:08:11.180 --> 02:08:11.760
Exactly right.

4774
02:08:11.840 --> 02:08:14.380
And so the big thinking error in

4775
02:08:14.380 --> 02:08:17.120
apps is finding somebody who's completely

4776
02:08:17.120 --> 02:08:18.220
compatible with us.

4777
02:08:18.220 --> 02:08:20.920
The technology enables compatibility.

4778
02:08:21.640 --> 02:08:23.000
The technology is-

4779
02:08:23.000 --> 02:08:24.160
Enables you to find compatibility?

4780
02:08:24.160 --> 02:08:25.300
To find people who are more and

4781
02:08:25.300 --> 02:08:26.400
more and more compatible that you

4782
02:08:26.400 --> 02:08:28.340
couldn't on the human market.

4783
02:08:29.020 --> 02:08:30.840
And so that matchmakers your parents

4784
02:08:30.840 --> 02:08:31.860
wouldn't find for you or certainly

4785
02:08:31.860 --> 02:08:33.020
blind dates or somebody

4786
02:08:33.020 --> 02:08:34.420
you meet in a bar, you just,

4787
02:08:34.580 --> 02:08:35.840
you know, it's a crapshoot for compatibility,

4788
02:08:35.960 --> 02:08:36.820
which is actually

4789
02:08:36.820 --> 02:08:37.380
what you need.

4790
02:08:37.560 --> 02:08:38.500
We're too compatible.

4791
02:08:39.260 --> 02:08:40.480
This is something that most people

4792
02:08:40.480 --> 02:08:41.180
don't understand.

4793
02:08:41.360 --> 02:08:42.000
That sounds crazy.

4794
02:08:42.080 --> 02:08:42.860
Yeah, I know.

4795
02:08:43.040 --> 02:08:44.820
And so, but people will sort on

4796
02:08:44.820 --> 02:08:46.440
their political views and their likes

4797
02:08:46.440 --> 02:08:47.680
and their dislikes and,

4798
02:08:47.680 --> 02:08:48.800
physical characteristics.

4799
02:08:48.960 --> 02:08:50.220
What you find is that people that

4800
02:08:50.220 --> 02:08:51.680
match up on compatibility,

4801
02:08:53.280 --> 02:08:56.020
ex ante, a priori in the dating

4802
02:08:56.020 --> 02:08:58.200
market, they even look alike, right?

4803
02:08:58.460 --> 02:09:00.360
And that's a problem.

4804
02:09:00.620 --> 02:09:01.720
You know, it's basically you wind

4805
02:09:01.720 --> 02:09:03.380
up looking for somebody who's effectively

4806
02:09:03.380 --> 02:09:04.000
your sibling,

4807
02:09:04.560 --> 02:09:06.820
which is my adult kids say is

4808
02:09:06.820 --> 02:09:07.780
not hot.

4809
02:09:08.020 --> 02:09:08.420
That's not hot.

4810
02:09:08.520 --> 02:09:09.120
Not hot.

4811
02:09:09.300 --> 02:09:09.720
Not hot.

4812
02:09:09.780 --> 02:09:10.980
And so when people are looking for

4813
02:09:10.980 --> 02:09:12.760
excess compatibility, they like the

4814
02:09:12.760 --> 02:09:13.240
person less,

4815
02:09:13.280 --> 02:09:14.420
they find them less attractive.

4816
02:09:14.420 --> 02:09:15.660
What you need is a base of

4817
02:09:15.660 --> 02:09:17.180
compatibility, which is lower than

4818
02:09:17.180 --> 02:09:17.580
you think.

4819
02:09:17.700 --> 02:09:19.720
And then tons of complementarity,

4820
02:09:19.900 --> 02:09:21.580
which is interesting and sexy.

4821
02:09:22.400 --> 02:09:23.280
You want difference.

4822
02:09:24.000 --> 02:09:24.120
Yes.

4823
02:09:25.000 --> 02:09:25.480
Agreed.

4824
02:09:25.520 --> 02:09:26.460
Not opposites.

4825
02:09:26.640 --> 02:09:27.380
Opposites don't attract.

4826
02:09:27.520 --> 02:09:30.400
Where do you want, you're now confusing me.

4827
02:09:30.540 --> 02:09:32.660
Where do you want things to be?

4828
02:09:32.780 --> 02:09:33.860
Where do you want to be compatible?

4829
02:09:34.080 --> 02:09:37.020
You need basics on non-negotiable values.

4830
02:09:37.260 --> 02:09:37.600
Preach.

4831
02:09:37.780 --> 02:09:38.040
Right.

4832
02:09:38.320 --> 02:09:39.620
Non-negotiable values.

4833
02:09:39.960 --> 02:09:41.620
Negotiable values doesn't matter.

4834
02:09:42.160 --> 02:09:43.700
People think that too many values

4835
02:09:43.700 --> 02:09:45.820
are non-negotiable that are actually negotiable.

4836
02:09:46.860 --> 02:09:48.140
Politics shouldn't be in there.

4837
02:09:48.660 --> 02:09:50.240
You should not sort on politics.

4838
02:09:50.380 --> 02:09:52.800
Now, 71% of political liberals say

4839
02:09:52.800 --> 02:09:54.240
they won't date a conservative.

4840
02:09:54.820 --> 02:09:56.760
41% of conservatives say they won't

4841
02:09:56.760 --> 02:09:58.260
date a liberal, which just shows that conservatives

4842
02:09:58.260 --> 02:10:00.600
have lower standards politically than liberals.

4843
02:10:01.760 --> 02:10:03.320
And maybe it's men versus women or

4844
02:10:03.320 --> 02:10:03.880
something like that.

4845
02:10:03.960 --> 02:10:04.620
I'm not going to look into the

4846
02:10:04.620 --> 02:10:05.000
data more.

4847
02:10:05.080 --> 02:10:06.500
But the whole point is that that's

4848
02:10:06.500 --> 02:10:08.220
a ridiculous barrier.

4849
02:10:08.360 --> 02:10:09.500
That's a ridiculous barrier.

4850
02:10:09.500 --> 02:10:12.040
That's basically like classifying

4851
02:10:12.040 --> 02:10:13.220
being a Democrat or Republican,

4852
02:10:13.580 --> 02:10:15.440
like being Jewish or Catholic or atheist.

4853
02:10:15.960 --> 02:10:17.020
It's interesting, man.

4854
02:10:17.160 --> 02:10:20.180
Like this is one area where I'm

4855
02:10:20.180 --> 02:10:22.580
with you in the abstract, but political

4856
02:10:22.580 --> 02:10:24.140
stuff's gotten so weird.

4857
02:10:24.360 --> 02:10:26.840
People are so devout about it that

4858
02:10:26.840 --> 02:10:27.800
that isn't interesting.

4859
02:10:28.000 --> 02:10:29.260
In the moment, I don't want to

4860
02:10:29.260 --> 02:10:31.920
be like, even I try not to

4861
02:10:31.920 --> 02:10:32.560
be dogmatic.

4862
02:10:33.440 --> 02:10:36.520
But even if I were, I'm not

4863
02:10:36.520 --> 02:10:37.240
being dogmatic.

4864
02:10:37.240 --> 02:10:39.440
If they're dogmatic, that's not interesting

4865
02:10:39.440 --> 02:10:39.760
to me.

4866
02:10:39.840 --> 02:10:40.460
Yeah, I get it.

4867
02:10:40.540 --> 02:10:41.920
And one of the best ways, actually,

4868
02:10:42.220 --> 02:10:43.520
is what I recommend to my students,

4869
02:10:43.600 --> 02:10:44.020
for example,

4870
02:10:44.080 --> 02:10:46.660
is that they don't talk at all

4871
02:10:46.660 --> 02:10:48.340
about politics for four dates.

4872
02:10:48.560 --> 02:10:50.800
To see if I really am into

4873
02:10:50.800 --> 02:10:52.060
you, it's not until we get into

4874
02:10:52.060 --> 02:10:52.440
that thing.

4875
02:10:52.500 --> 02:10:53.040
Exactly right.

4876
02:10:53.200 --> 02:10:55.160
So you don't actually, so the dogma

4877
02:10:55.160 --> 02:10:56.320
or something, and if you can start

4878
02:10:56.320 --> 02:10:57.040
to fall in love,

4879
02:10:57.600 --> 02:10:58.780
suddenly you're less dogmatic.

4880
02:10:59.640 --> 02:11:01.120
You're less dogmatic about politics.

4881
02:11:01.200 --> 02:11:02.320
And the person you're falling in love

4882
02:11:02.320 --> 02:11:03.780
with, when they say something that

4883
02:11:03.780 --> 02:11:04.080
you would have

4884
02:11:04.080 --> 02:11:05.620
previously thought was a non-starter,

4885
02:11:05.760 --> 02:11:08.180
was a deal breaker, it no longer is.

4886
02:11:08.280 --> 02:11:10.300
Are you and your wife politically aligned?

4887
02:11:10.840 --> 02:11:12.280
Kind of now, just because we've been

4888
02:11:12.280 --> 02:11:13.200
together for so long.

4889
02:11:13.280 --> 02:11:14.280
But you weren't in the beginning.

4890
02:11:14.320 --> 02:11:15.300
No, she was Spanish.

4891
02:11:15.740 --> 02:11:17.740
I mean, she was brought up in

4892
02:11:17.740 --> 02:11:20.640
a hard-red, atheist family.

4893
02:11:22.940 --> 02:11:25.040
It's like complete socialists.

4894
02:11:25.180 --> 02:11:26.540
They were on the losing side of

4895
02:11:26.540 --> 02:11:28.080
the Spanish Civil War, and they were

4896
02:11:28.080 --> 02:11:28.940
all atheists.

4897
02:11:29.020 --> 02:11:30.800
She hadn't been to church since her

4898
02:11:30.800 --> 02:11:31.520
first communion.

4899
02:11:32.020 --> 02:11:32.420
Interesting.

4900
02:11:32.420 --> 02:11:34.700
I quietly assumed that was the first

4901
02:11:34.700 --> 02:11:36.300
thing you guys bonded over was religion.

4902
02:11:36.460 --> 02:11:36.860
Oh, no way.

4903
02:11:36.960 --> 02:11:37.800
That was just like, that was a

4904
02:11:37.800 --> 02:11:39.040
10-year project for me.

4905
02:11:39.140 --> 02:11:39.400
Wow.

4906
02:11:39.640 --> 02:11:39.960
Totally.

4907
02:11:40.160 --> 02:11:41.180
10-year project for me.

4908
02:11:43.380 --> 02:11:44.740
But, you know, when I met her,

4909
02:11:44.780 --> 02:11:45.980
she's like, no, I don't believe in marriage.

4910
02:11:46.580 --> 02:11:47.880
That's an antiquated institution.

4911
02:11:47.980 --> 02:11:48.500
Doesn't make sense.

4912
02:11:48.920 --> 02:11:49.360
We'll see.

4913
02:11:50.440 --> 02:11:50.880
We'll see.

4914
02:11:51.100 --> 02:11:53.240
I mean, I moved to Barcelona to

4915
02:11:53.240 --> 02:11:54.540
try to convince her to marry me.

4916
02:11:54.660 --> 02:11:55.700
How long were you guys together before

4917
02:11:55.700 --> 02:11:56.200
you got married?

4918
02:11:57.460 --> 02:11:58.780
Well, I hoped that it would be

4919
02:11:58.780 --> 02:11:59.940
very short, but it took me two

4920
02:11:59.940 --> 02:12:00.640
years to close the deal.

4921
02:12:00.820 --> 02:12:01.140
Okay.

4922
02:12:01.140 --> 02:12:02.520
From meet to married?

4923
02:12:02.660 --> 02:12:04.600
No, from moving to marriage.

4924
02:12:04.740 --> 02:12:04.860
Okay.

4925
02:12:04.940 --> 02:12:06.000
How long from meet to marry?

4926
02:12:06.440 --> 02:12:06.740
Three.

4927
02:12:07.200 --> 02:12:08.760
So we were apart for a year

4928
02:12:08.760 --> 02:12:09.860
and I was, you know, right.

4929
02:12:09.860 --> 02:12:11.000
And she didn't speak any English.

4930
02:12:11.120 --> 02:12:12.380
I didn't speak any Spanish or Catalan.

4931
02:12:13.620 --> 02:12:15.740
And so I thought I'm gonna...

4932
02:12:15.740 --> 02:12:16.360
The only...

4933
02:12:16.360 --> 02:12:17.320
I had a premonition.

4934
02:12:17.500 --> 02:12:18.720
I mean, I met her for a week.

4935
02:12:19.160 --> 02:12:20.100
And I told my dad, I think

4936
02:12:20.100 --> 02:12:21.460
I'm gonna marry this girl.

4937
02:12:21.700 --> 02:12:21.980
Whoa.

4938
02:12:22.060 --> 02:12:23.880
He's like, can't wait to meet her.

4939
02:12:23.960 --> 02:12:25.240
Like, I got some problems.

4940
02:12:25.400 --> 02:12:27.860
She doesn't speak English.

4941
02:12:27.920 --> 02:12:28.820
She doesn't live in the United States

4942
02:12:28.820 --> 02:12:30.080
and she doesn't believe in marriage.

4943
02:12:30.080 --> 02:12:32.300
But I think it's surmountable.

4944
02:12:32.400 --> 02:12:32.940
Other than that.

4945
02:12:33.040 --> 02:12:33.200
Yeah.

4946
02:12:33.520 --> 02:12:34.780
And so, you know, we kind of

4947
02:12:34.780 --> 02:12:35.680
stayed in touch for a year.

4948
02:12:35.780 --> 02:12:37.620
And then I quit my job and

4949
02:12:37.620 --> 02:12:38.560
I moved to Barcelona.

4950
02:12:38.700 --> 02:12:39.600
I took a job in the Barcelona

4951
02:12:39.600 --> 02:12:43.060
Symphony because I had this very strong sense.

4952
02:12:43.280 --> 02:12:44.800
And by the way, maybe it didn't

4953
02:12:44.800 --> 02:12:45.180
work out.

4954
02:12:45.220 --> 02:12:46.780
It was an entrepreneurial thing to do.

4955
02:12:46.800 --> 02:12:49.160
And I was 24 and it was okay.

4956
02:12:49.440 --> 02:12:51.520
And I worked on it and worked

4957
02:12:51.520 --> 02:12:52.900
on it, learned the language.

4958
02:12:54.060 --> 02:12:55.200
And we were in love.

4959
02:12:56.020 --> 02:12:58.500
And when I was 26 and I

4960
02:12:58.500 --> 02:13:00.560
said, we have to get married.

4961
02:13:00.640 --> 02:13:01.920
You have to marry me.

4962
02:13:02.640 --> 02:13:03.380
She said, yes.

4963
02:13:04.380 --> 02:13:05.660
And, you know, and then little by

4964
02:13:05.660 --> 02:13:06.860
little by little, you come together.

4965
02:13:06.960 --> 02:13:09.700
See, the couples change, people change

4966
02:13:09.700 --> 02:13:10.940
over the course of their lives.

4967
02:13:11.260 --> 02:13:11.460
For sure.

4968
02:13:11.580 --> 02:13:13.100
And couples change together.

4969
02:13:13.660 --> 02:13:14.980
And the couples that don't do well

4970
02:13:14.980 --> 02:13:16.480
change apart because of the hubris.

4971
02:13:16.640 --> 02:13:17.260
Don't change together.

4972
02:13:17.380 --> 02:13:19.760
There's too much pride is what comes

4973
02:13:19.760 --> 02:13:20.060
from it.

4974
02:13:20.120 --> 02:13:21.720
So what will happen is tons of

4975
02:13:21.720 --> 02:13:22.700
difference at the very beginning.

4976
02:13:23.340 --> 02:13:26.360
Lots of love glues you together and

4977
02:13:26.360 --> 02:13:27.880
then you start to change together.

4978
02:13:28.040 --> 02:13:30.140
The ultimate goal, by the way, for

4979
02:13:30.140 --> 02:13:32.380
a marriage relationship that lasts,

4980
02:13:33.020 --> 02:13:33.780
tons of passion.

4981
02:13:33.880 --> 02:13:34.980
We talked about the neurochemical

4982
02:13:34.980 --> 02:13:38.260
cascade of falling in love, of love addiction.

4983
02:13:38.840 --> 02:13:41.380
But within five years, what you need

4984
02:13:41.380 --> 02:13:42.540
to be left with is what we

4985
02:13:42.540 --> 02:13:43.720
call companionate love.

4986
02:13:43.800 --> 02:13:45.600
Your goal within five years is to

4987
02:13:45.600 --> 02:13:46.900
be best friends with the person.

4988
02:13:47.080 --> 02:13:48.080
That's your goal.

4989
02:13:48.560 --> 02:13:50.560
There's lots of passion and companionate

4990
02:13:50.560 --> 02:13:51.780
love that also sounds not hot.

4991
02:13:51.780 --> 02:13:55.280
You know, here's my companion, Mrs. Brooks.

4992
02:13:55.920 --> 02:13:56.340
You know, no.

4993
02:13:57.360 --> 02:13:59.720
Companionate love is this is the person

4994
02:13:59.720 --> 02:14:01.880
that you'll be looking into her eyes

4995
02:14:01.880 --> 02:14:02.640
on your dying day.

4996
02:14:02.900 --> 02:14:04.500
And then who knows all your secrets

4997
02:14:04.500 --> 02:14:06.320
with whom you can be truly yourself,

4998
02:14:06.320 --> 02:14:08.800
who really has your best interests

4999
02:14:08.800 --> 02:14:09.360
at heart.

5000
02:14:09.740 --> 02:14:11.320
That's what companionate love is.

5001
02:14:11.380 --> 02:14:12.660
And not every relationship can get

5002
02:14:12.660 --> 02:14:12.900
to that.

5003
02:14:13.000 --> 02:14:13.460
But that's the goal.

5004
02:14:13.480 --> 02:14:13.820
What do you think though?

5005
02:14:13.900 --> 02:14:16.220
What's the importance of keeping sex alive?

5006
02:14:17.740 --> 02:14:21.720
Because that's a physical bond that

5007
02:14:21.720 --> 02:14:23.460
is the most intimate understanding

5008
02:14:23.460 --> 02:14:25.860
of your relationships.

5009
02:14:26.020 --> 02:14:28.480
It's an expression of your greatest intimacy.

5010
02:14:28.940 --> 02:14:30.120
It's also super fun.

5011
02:14:30.340 --> 02:14:30.660
Yeah.

5012
02:14:30.740 --> 02:14:31.400
A and B.

5013
02:14:31.580 --> 02:14:31.800
Yeah.

5014
02:14:32.320 --> 02:14:33.700
So I want to make sure that

5015
02:14:33.700 --> 02:14:34.060
people hear that.

5016
02:14:34.080 --> 02:14:35.580
You can have sex with people you're

5017
02:14:35.580 --> 02:14:36.140
not in love with.

5018
02:14:36.420 --> 02:14:37.260
You know, people do that all the

5019
02:14:37.260 --> 02:14:37.720
time too.

5020
02:14:37.960 --> 02:14:38.380
Carfax.

5021
02:14:38.520 --> 02:14:41.260
It's way, way, way more satisfying

5022
02:14:41.260 --> 02:14:42.880
when it's in the expression of your

5023
02:14:42.880 --> 02:14:43.460
greatest intimacy.

5024
02:14:44.320 --> 02:14:46.960
That's why the happiest people have

5025
02:14:46.960 --> 02:14:49.580
one sexual partner in a given year.

5026
02:14:50.120 --> 02:14:51.160
It doesn't mean one in your whole life.

5027
02:14:51.820 --> 02:14:52.660
It means one in a given year.

5028
02:14:52.660 --> 02:14:53.400
There's actually been a study on that?

5029
02:14:53.440 --> 02:14:54.320
There's a study on that using the

5030
02:14:54.320 --> 02:14:55.440
general social survey at the University

5031
02:14:55.440 --> 02:14:55.860
of Chicago.

5032
02:14:56.380 --> 02:14:56.480
Yep.

5033
02:14:56.820 --> 02:14:58.240
Is that, to me, that just sounds

5034
02:14:58.240 --> 02:15:00.120
like a proxy for committed relationship.

5035
02:15:00.420 --> 02:15:01.440
Yeah, it is.

5036
02:15:01.540 --> 02:15:03.040
And the greatest expression of the

5037
02:15:03.040 --> 02:15:04.840
deep, deep, deep intimacy and commitment

5038
02:15:04.840 --> 02:15:05.860
is usually sex.

5039
02:15:06.060 --> 02:15:07.460
Because when people ask Lisa and I,

5040
02:15:07.560 --> 02:15:09.580
like, what's the secret to a long marriage?

5041
02:15:09.580 --> 02:15:12.220
We always say, like, one of our

5042
02:15:12.220 --> 02:15:12.720
top things,

5043
02:15:12.840 --> 02:15:14.020
obviously communicate, but have a

5044
02:15:14.020 --> 02:15:14.440
lot of sex.

5045
02:15:14.680 --> 02:15:16.740
Like, you don't want to become roommates.

5046
02:15:17.380 --> 02:15:19.620
And there is something also, and I

5047
02:15:19.620 --> 02:15:20.640
don't know what you think about this,

5048
02:15:20.760 --> 02:15:23.920
but there's something about, there's

5049
02:15:23.920 --> 02:15:26.940
an electricity to crossing that line.

5050
02:15:26.940 --> 02:15:28.780
And there's one person that you cross

5051
02:15:28.780 --> 02:15:29.540
that line with.

5052
02:15:30.240 --> 02:15:33.820
And not having that, like, one for that,

5053
02:15:34.000 --> 02:15:35.900
just entire part of your life to

5054
02:15:35.900 --> 02:15:37.680
die and for you to never have

5055
02:15:37.680 --> 02:15:38.260
that thing.

5056
02:15:39.140 --> 02:15:40.840
Well, there's tons of oxytocin that

5057
02:15:40.840 --> 02:15:41.980
happens during sexual activity

5058
02:15:41.980 --> 02:15:43.780
that you don't get otherwise as well.

5059
02:15:44.240 --> 02:15:45.820
And that bonds you together again

5060
02:15:45.820 --> 02:15:46.120
and again.

5061
02:15:46.300 --> 02:15:47.340
Look, there are other ways to get

5062
02:15:47.340 --> 02:15:48.340
it too, by the way.

5063
02:15:48.400 --> 02:15:49.400
So sex is not the only way.

5064
02:15:49.860 --> 02:15:51.340
People often ask, is it bad that

5065
02:15:51.340 --> 02:15:51.940
couples fight?

5066
02:15:52.400 --> 02:15:53.820
And the answer is it's bad when

5067
02:15:53.820 --> 02:15:54.640
they don't.

5068
02:15:55.300 --> 02:15:56.820
And I mean, some people fight a lot.

5069
02:15:56.920 --> 02:15:57.620
Some people fight a little.

5070
02:15:57.680 --> 02:15:58.840
My wife and I fight a lot.

5071
02:15:59.280 --> 02:16:00.020
We fight a lot.

5072
02:16:00.100 --> 02:16:01.480
We have a lot of arguments.

5073
02:16:01.640 --> 02:16:02.360
Because she's Spanish?

5074
02:16:02.480 --> 02:16:03.540
Because yeah, I mean, for them, it's

5075
02:16:03.540 --> 02:16:05.320
just a form of communication, you know?

5076
02:16:05.960 --> 02:16:07.460
And there's nothing that's not on

5077
02:16:07.460 --> 02:16:08.040
the surface.

5078
02:16:08.040 --> 02:16:09.480
And so that was hard.

5079
02:16:09.560 --> 02:16:10.820
The first five or 10 years, I

5080
02:16:10.820 --> 02:16:11.620
was very aggrieved.

5081
02:16:11.620 --> 02:16:12.920
Because you're not built like that.

5082
02:16:12.940 --> 02:16:13.500
I'm American.

5083
02:16:13.820 --> 02:16:14.800
You know, we didn't do that growing

5084
02:16:14.800 --> 02:16:16.060
up in the Pacific Northwest, did we?

5085
02:16:16.340 --> 02:16:16.880
I mean, it was like...

5086
02:16:17.320 --> 02:16:17.940
Ah, yeah.

5087
02:16:18.140 --> 02:16:18.860
That was not...

5088
02:16:18.860 --> 02:16:20.260
Learning to fight well was a big

5089
02:16:20.260 --> 02:16:20.860
thing I had to learn.

5090
02:16:21.120 --> 02:16:23.620
But the key is about that couples

5091
02:16:23.620 --> 02:16:24.700
that never, never, never fight,

5092
02:16:24.800 --> 02:16:26.040
they're missing out on some of the

5093
02:16:26.040 --> 02:16:28.340
greatest source of intimacy.

5094
02:16:28.680 --> 02:16:30.160
Because the friction is there.

5095
02:16:30.280 --> 02:16:31.800
Yeah, you're saying things that you

5096
02:16:31.800 --> 02:16:33.320
think that you weren't saying before.

5097
02:16:33.620 --> 02:16:34.080
That's interesting.

5098
02:16:34.200 --> 02:16:35.160
I heard you say this before.

5099
02:16:35.160 --> 02:16:39.020
Take a second to say that very clearly.

5100
02:16:39.560 --> 02:16:41.260
The idea of...

5101
02:16:41.260 --> 02:16:42.180
Of intimacy through fighting.

5102
02:16:42.360 --> 02:16:42.740
Yeah.

5103
02:16:43.580 --> 02:16:45.800
People often say, it's so weird, you know,

5104
02:16:45.840 --> 02:16:46.960
after we have a big fight, then

5105
02:16:46.960 --> 02:16:47.900
we make love.

5106
02:16:48.140 --> 02:16:49.420
As if it were make up sex.

5107
02:16:49.520 --> 02:16:49.620
I've never once done that.

5108
02:16:49.820 --> 02:16:50.920
I never do that.

5109
02:16:50.940 --> 02:16:52.260
Are you in the mood for sex

5110
02:16:52.260 --> 02:16:53.140
after you've been in a fight?

5111
02:16:53.280 --> 02:16:55.100
Well, it depends on how the fight resolves.

5112
02:16:55.500 --> 02:16:56.860
But the point is that a lot

5113
02:16:56.860 --> 02:16:57.740
of people do that.

5114
02:16:57.820 --> 02:16:59.320
And the reason is because they're

5115
02:16:59.320 --> 02:17:01.660
raw and intimate in their communication.

5116
02:17:01.700 --> 02:17:03.260
Sometimes for the first time in a

5117
02:17:03.260 --> 02:17:04.020
long time.

5118
02:17:04.020 --> 02:17:04.240
Okay.

5119
02:17:04.240 --> 02:17:06.080
For the first time in a long time.

5120
02:17:06.160 --> 02:17:07.000
So if you're the kind of couple

5121
02:17:07.000 --> 02:17:07.580
that has,

5122
02:17:07.720 --> 02:17:08.760
you're not seeing each other very

5123
02:17:08.760 --> 02:17:10.040
much because you're working really hard

5124
02:17:10.040 --> 02:17:11.780
and you're on the road and you're

5125
02:17:11.780 --> 02:17:12.740
not talking about things

5126
02:17:12.740 --> 02:17:14.000
and a lot of tension is building up.

5127
02:17:14.260 --> 02:17:15.640
And then finally you have a knockdown

5128
02:17:15.640 --> 02:17:16.280
drag out fight.

5129
02:17:16.400 --> 02:17:18.460
And you're saying things that you

5130
02:17:18.460 --> 02:17:20.980
think that are deeply intimate,

5131
02:17:21.160 --> 02:17:22.640
that are your deepest feelings.

5132
02:17:22.680 --> 02:17:24.220
That you would never say at work

5133
02:17:24.220 --> 02:17:24.960
because you don't have the kind of

5134
02:17:24.960 --> 02:17:25.720
relationship with other people.

5135
02:17:25.820 --> 02:17:26.800
You don't want to demoralize them.

5136
02:17:26.820 --> 02:17:27.620
You don't have trust.

5137
02:17:28.100 --> 02:17:29.160
You have enough trust.

5138
02:17:29.220 --> 02:17:30.480
And you say things that might be,

5139
02:17:30.740 --> 02:17:31.560
they might be cutting.

5140
02:17:32.220 --> 02:17:33.500
They might be wounding, but they're

5141
02:17:33.500 --> 02:17:34.140
deeply intimate.

5142
02:17:34.140 --> 02:17:35.920
You have an intimate bond.

5143
02:17:36.000 --> 02:17:38.920
You have a spiritual bond with that

5144
02:17:38.920 --> 02:17:39.460
other person

5145
02:17:39.460 --> 02:17:41.200
because of the intimacy of the communication,

5146
02:17:41.380 --> 02:17:42.400
even though it was wounding.

5147
02:17:42.620 --> 02:17:44.040
That's really interesting.

5148
02:17:44.280 --> 02:17:46.220
So I will say this.

5149
02:17:46.240 --> 02:17:48.660
I have had moments where I was

5150
02:17:48.660 --> 02:17:51.400
completely uninterested in sex

5151
02:17:51.400 --> 02:17:54.240
until we had, I wouldn't even necessarily

5152
02:17:54.240 --> 02:17:54.960
say fight

5153
02:17:54.960 --> 02:17:56.580
because fight implies that it's like

5154
02:17:56.580 --> 02:17:57.300
really fiery.

5155
02:17:58.200 --> 02:18:01.020
There was one big disagreement that

5156
02:18:01.020 --> 02:18:02.160
my wife and I got into

5157
02:18:02.160 --> 02:18:03.700
and it was really interesting.

5158
02:18:04.920 --> 02:18:07.600
When I brought up the thing,

5159
02:18:07.700 --> 02:18:09.300
we happened to be in a swimming pool.

5160
02:18:09.840 --> 02:18:11.180
And so my wife likes me to

5161
02:18:11.180 --> 02:18:11.620
hold her

5162
02:18:11.620 --> 02:18:12.660
and walk her around the pool.

5163
02:18:13.020 --> 02:18:15.020
And it ended up being this amazing way

5164
02:18:15.020 --> 02:18:16.100
to have this argument because it was

5165
02:18:16.100 --> 02:18:17.320
really like,

5166
02:18:17.720 --> 02:18:19.480
hey, I've been meaning to say this

5167
02:18:19.480 --> 02:18:20.940
thing for a few days now.

5168
02:18:21.340 --> 02:18:23.400
Here's how this thing made me feel.

5169
02:18:23.520 --> 02:18:24.740
Like, let's really get into it.

5170
02:18:24.920 --> 02:18:26.920
And we couldn't see each other's eyes

5171
02:18:27.400 --> 02:18:29.680
and it made it way easier to

5172
02:18:29.680 --> 02:18:30.480
have the conversation.

5173
02:18:30.880 --> 02:18:32.680
So we were like cheek to cheek,

5174
02:18:32.680 --> 02:18:35.720
but we couldn't see each other's eyes.

5175
02:18:35.840 --> 02:18:37.300
So there, it just became easier

5176
02:18:37.300 --> 02:18:38.600
to like get those things off of

5177
02:18:38.600 --> 02:18:39.040
our chest.

5178
02:18:39.320 --> 02:18:40.780
It was really wonderful.

5179
02:18:41.000 --> 02:18:42.980
But I, and so I didn't want

5180
02:18:42.980 --> 02:18:43.340
to have sex

5181
02:18:43.340 --> 02:18:44.520
until we had that conversation,

5182
02:18:44.520 --> 02:18:46.020
but it wasn't like, oh, I'm going

5183
02:18:46.020 --> 02:18:46.680
to run you upstairs.

5184
02:18:46.680 --> 02:18:48.520
And like, I've never had that response.

5185
02:18:48.520 --> 02:18:49.460
Like I don't-

5186
02:18:49.460 --> 02:18:50.600
People are different for sure.

5187
02:18:50.680 --> 02:18:52.160
But it's important that you have those

5188
02:18:52.160 --> 02:18:53.580
relationship moments

5189
02:18:53.580 --> 02:18:55.320
and those might be as bonding.

5190
02:18:55.520 --> 02:18:57.340
Your fights might be as bonding for

5191
02:18:57.340 --> 02:18:57.880
you as-

5192
02:18:57.880 --> 02:18:58.540
When done well.

5193
02:18:58.700 --> 02:18:59.140
Are you-

5194
02:18:59.140 --> 02:18:59.600
Yeah, for sure.

5195
02:18:59.680 --> 02:19:00.320
And there's technique.

5196
02:19:00.620 --> 02:19:02.560
Yeah. Talk to me about, so-

5197
02:19:02.560 --> 02:19:03.980
My guess is that you're in a

5198
02:19:03.980 --> 02:19:05.140
21 year marriage

5199
02:19:05.140 --> 02:19:06.100
and you're going to be married until

5200
02:19:06.100 --> 02:19:06.420
you die.

5201
02:19:06.760 --> 02:19:07.000
Yes.

5202
02:19:07.100 --> 02:19:07.680
You're going to die.

5203
02:19:07.720 --> 02:19:08.920
I mean, until the death of you part.

5204
02:19:09.180 --> 02:19:09.820
For sure.

5205
02:19:11.440 --> 02:19:13.400
And so my guess is I could

5206
02:19:13.400 --> 02:19:14.880
probably write a script

5207
02:19:14.880 --> 02:19:16.560
for your fights based on that.

5208
02:19:17.220 --> 02:19:19.360
And when something's not right,

5209
02:19:20.640 --> 02:19:22.920
the accusation is that we are having

5210
02:19:22.920 --> 02:19:23.420
a problem.

5211
02:19:24.660 --> 02:19:26.080
Now, when you look at a couple

5212
02:19:26.080 --> 02:19:27.060
that's tenuous

5213
02:19:27.060 --> 02:19:28.940
and really having trouble and really

5214
02:19:28.940 --> 02:19:29.420
in danger,

5215
02:19:29.700 --> 02:19:31.560
it's like you're doing something

5216
02:19:31.560 --> 02:19:33.640
and it makes me feel a particular way.

5217
02:19:33.880 --> 02:19:34.340
So important.

5218
02:19:34.580 --> 02:19:35.300
Super important.

5219
02:19:35.360 --> 02:19:36.340
And just changing the language

5220
02:19:36.340 --> 02:19:39.280
because language change has very strong

5221
02:19:39.280 --> 02:19:40.140
cognitive impact.

5222
02:19:40.520 --> 02:19:42.500
So if you want your fights to

5223
02:19:42.500 --> 02:19:42.700
be-

5224
02:19:42.700 --> 02:19:43.200
You're going to fight

5225
02:19:43.200 --> 02:19:45.140
and it's important that you relate

5226
02:19:45.140 --> 02:19:45.620
to each other

5227
02:19:45.620 --> 02:19:46.940
and you're honest with each other.

5228
02:19:47.100 --> 02:19:49.220
But you want it to stop actually creating

5229
02:19:49.220 --> 02:19:50.420
so much brain damage.

5230
02:19:50.920 --> 02:19:53.500
Just change the pronouns.

5231
02:19:54.340 --> 02:19:55.320
That's the first thing to do

5232
02:19:55.320 --> 02:19:56.600
is to change the pronouns in the fights.

5233
02:19:56.720 --> 02:19:57.720
Don't say I and you.

5234
02:19:57.980 --> 02:19:59.240
Start saying we and us.

5235
02:19:59.760 --> 02:20:00.380
We and us.

5236
02:20:00.380 --> 02:20:01.640
We have to do this thing.

5237
02:20:01.780 --> 02:20:04.560
Whenever we do this thing, we have

5238
02:20:04.560 --> 02:20:04.980
a problem.

5239
02:20:05.720 --> 02:20:07.760
And you'll find you're stumbling across it

5240
02:20:07.760 --> 02:20:08.440
at the very beginning.

5241
02:20:08.560 --> 02:20:09.700
You'll find it because it's because-

5242
02:20:09.700 --> 02:20:10.600
And you did this-

5243
02:20:10.600 --> 02:20:11.900
We had this problem.

5244
02:20:12.440 --> 02:20:14.180
We had this breakdown in communication

5245
02:20:14.180 --> 02:20:15.980
because then you're trying to solve

5246
02:20:15.980 --> 02:20:16.680
a problem together

5247
02:20:16.680 --> 02:20:18.200
and it's a joint problem you're trying

5248
02:20:18.200 --> 02:20:18.660
to solve.

5249
02:20:18.800 --> 02:20:20.180
And when you solve it, you've made

5250
02:20:20.180 --> 02:20:21.160
progress together

5251
02:20:21.160 --> 02:20:23.740
as opposed to I won and you lost.

5252
02:20:23.880 --> 02:20:24.820
That's really-

5253
02:20:24.820 --> 02:20:25.640
Super important.

5254
02:20:25.840 --> 02:20:27.220
And just using different pronouns

5255
02:20:27.700 --> 02:20:30.740
it can actually repair a multitude

5256
02:20:30.740 --> 02:20:31.740
of problems.

5257
02:20:31.920 --> 02:20:33.280
And something my wife and I do,

5258
02:20:33.360 --> 02:20:34.700
and this has been really powerful

5259
02:20:34.700 --> 02:20:35.160
for us,

5260
02:20:35.200 --> 02:20:36.900
is we talk in insecurities when we

5261
02:20:36.900 --> 02:20:37.580
get into an argument.

5262
02:20:38.240 --> 02:20:40.360
So if one of us is getting angry,

5263
02:20:40.620 --> 02:20:42.040
it's like we have a shared understanding.

5264
02:20:42.200 --> 02:20:43.940
If you're angry, it's because your insecurity

5265
02:20:43.940 --> 02:20:45.040
has been tripped.

5266
02:20:46.320 --> 02:20:47.200
So confess.

5267
02:20:47.340 --> 02:20:48.680
Like what's the insecurity?

5268
02:20:48.840 --> 02:20:50.140
What's the thing that's bothering you?

5269
02:20:50.180 --> 02:20:51.620
So that you can get off of

5270
02:20:51.620 --> 02:20:52.880
the surface level argument,

5271
02:20:52.960 --> 02:20:54.980
which is usually very fruitless

5272
02:20:54.980 --> 02:20:56.800
and you can get down into-

5273
02:20:56.800 --> 02:20:57.520
It's something stupid.

5274
02:20:57.640 --> 02:20:59.260
It's like you finished the milk or

5275
02:20:59.260 --> 02:21:00.080
something stupid.

5276
02:21:00.400 --> 02:21:01.560
Right. And you finished the milk without

5277
02:21:01.560 --> 02:21:02.260
talking to me

5278
02:21:02.260 --> 02:21:03.740
and it makes me feel unseen, whatever.

5279
02:21:04.240 --> 02:21:06.660
And once you get down there, like,

5280
02:21:06.780 --> 02:21:08.480
ooh, whoa, why is that making you

5281
02:21:08.480 --> 02:21:09.000
feel unseen?

5282
02:21:09.220 --> 02:21:11.360
And also that the person isn't just,

5283
02:21:11.800 --> 02:21:13.120
I have an insecurity, you triggered

5284
02:21:13.120 --> 02:21:13.960
it, shame on you.

5285
02:21:14.080 --> 02:21:15.920
It's like, okay, I have an obligation

5286
02:21:16.540 --> 02:21:18.100
to work on my insecurities.

5287
02:21:18.280 --> 02:21:20.600
You have an obligation to care enough

5288
02:21:20.600 --> 02:21:21.240
about me

5289
02:21:21.240 --> 02:21:22.760
that you want to know,

5290
02:21:22.760 --> 02:21:24.860
but I can't just be like, you

5291
02:21:24.860 --> 02:21:25.460
have to deal with it.

5292
02:21:25.600 --> 02:21:27.060
I have an insecurity and you better

5293
02:21:27.060 --> 02:21:28.020
tread around it forever.

5294
02:21:28.740 --> 02:21:30.040
You're doing a lot right.

5295
02:21:30.320 --> 02:21:31.120
I can tell you that.

5296
02:21:31.200 --> 02:21:32.040
And this was one of the reasons

5297
02:21:32.040 --> 02:21:33.580
that you stayed so openly

5298
02:21:33.580 --> 02:21:34.820
that your marriage is the most important

5299
02:21:34.820 --> 02:21:35.360
thing in your life.

5300
02:21:35.640 --> 02:21:37.880
It's the central institution of your life.

5301
02:21:38.060 --> 02:21:39.360
I mean, like this goes all bust.

5302
02:21:39.540 --> 02:21:40.460
And by the way, this is going

5303
02:21:40.460 --> 02:21:40.840
to go bust.

5304
02:21:40.900 --> 02:21:41.760
It's all going to go bust.

5305
02:21:41.840 --> 02:21:42.040
Yeah.

5306
02:21:42.440 --> 02:21:42.700
Right?

5307
02:21:42.800 --> 02:21:44.420
But the one thing on your deathbed

5308
02:21:44.420 --> 02:21:45.640
is Lisa.

5309
02:21:46.600 --> 02:21:47.840
I mean, here's the problem.

5310
02:21:48.260 --> 02:21:49.320
One of you is going to die first.

5311
02:21:49.540 --> 02:21:49.820
Yes.

5312
02:21:50.160 --> 02:21:51.440
Although if you ask my wife, she

5313
02:21:51.440 --> 02:21:52.460
really wants us to die.

5314
02:21:53.640 --> 02:21:53.920
Simultaneously.

5315
02:21:54.620 --> 02:21:56.300
That would be like, she's like,

5316
02:21:56.360 --> 02:21:57.220
I don't care if I die in

5317
02:21:57.220 --> 02:21:57.620
a plane crash

5318
02:21:57.620 --> 02:21:58.460
as long as you're next to me.

5319
02:21:58.480 --> 02:21:59.020
And I'm like, what?

5320
02:21:59.480 --> 02:22:00.080
What are you talking about?

5321
02:22:00.220 --> 02:22:01.140
Why are we both going down?

5322
02:22:01.200 --> 02:22:01.920
Like, if I have to die in

5323
02:22:01.920 --> 02:22:02.300
a plane crash,

5324
02:22:02.360 --> 02:22:03.660
I want you to be safe on

5325
02:22:03.660 --> 02:22:03.980
the ground.

5326
02:22:04.200 --> 02:22:04.900
She's like, no way.

5327
02:22:04.940 --> 02:22:05.760
I'd want to be with you.

5328
02:22:07.140 --> 02:22:07.820
So yeah, that's my wife.

5329
02:22:07.820 --> 02:22:08.960
She says it out of love though.

5330
02:22:09.080 --> 02:22:10.520
So you actually laugh about it.

5331
02:22:10.780 --> 02:22:11.700
Yeah, I totally get where she's coming from.

5332
02:22:11.720 --> 02:22:12.480
I sure hope you die in a

5333
02:22:12.480 --> 02:22:13.400
plane crash with me.

5334
02:22:14.240 --> 02:22:15.140
Yeah, no, I get it.

5335
02:22:16.500 --> 02:22:18.160
But that's, you know, this is an

5336
02:22:18.160 --> 02:22:18.700
issue, right?

5337
02:22:18.920 --> 02:22:20.800
Because that you will be separated.

5338
02:22:21.040 --> 02:22:21.280
Yeah.

5339
02:22:21.280 --> 02:22:23.460
The data say that except under the

5340
02:22:23.460 --> 02:22:24.700
oddest of circumstances,

5341
02:22:24.700 --> 02:22:25.500
you'll be separated.

5342
02:22:26.240 --> 02:22:27.820
But what typically happens is really,

5343
02:22:27.960 --> 02:22:28.620
really happy couples,

5344
02:22:28.720 --> 02:22:30.420
except under conditions of bad luck,

5345
02:22:30.440 --> 02:22:31.620
they tend to live a long time,

5346
02:22:31.740 --> 02:22:32.360
have a long marriage.

5347
02:22:32.880 --> 02:22:34.260
And one of them dies and then

5348
02:22:34.260 --> 02:22:34.700
the other dies.

5349
02:22:35.520 --> 02:22:36.520
It's crazy, man.

5350
02:22:37.240 --> 02:22:38.780
Because you have a joint life.

5351
02:22:38.960 --> 02:22:39.860
You have a joint life together.

5352
02:22:40.180 --> 02:22:40.980
The enterprise.

5353
02:22:41.380 --> 02:22:42.540
It's the startup.

5354
02:22:42.780 --> 02:22:44.100
It's your co-founders.

5355
02:22:44.760 --> 02:22:46.440
The other thing that's really interesting too

5356
02:22:46.440 --> 02:22:47.660
is that a lot of the relationships

5357
02:22:47.660 --> 02:22:48.500
that do best

5358
02:22:48.500 --> 02:22:49.620
are startups, not mergers.

5359
02:22:50.860 --> 02:22:51.700
That's interesting.

5360
02:22:51.860 --> 02:22:54.120
Tell me more, meaning second marriage?

5361
02:22:54.260 --> 02:22:56.360
No, well, I mean, second marriages are,

5362
02:22:56.660 --> 02:22:57.480
sometimes they're really great,

5363
02:22:57.560 --> 02:22:59.940
but the marriages that have the greatest

5364
02:22:59.940 --> 02:23:00.960
likelihood of success,

5365
02:23:01.080 --> 02:23:02.740
they're entered into earlier

5366
02:23:02.740 --> 02:23:05.140
when you're both in life startup mode,

5367
02:23:05.140 --> 02:23:07.380
as opposed to I got my law degree

5368
02:23:07.380 --> 02:23:09.020
and you got your PhD and you

5369
02:23:09.020 --> 02:23:09.580
got your startup

5370
02:23:09.580 --> 02:23:10.780
and I got my startup and I

5371
02:23:10.780 --> 02:23:11.140
think we're,

5372
02:23:11.320 --> 02:23:12.660
and we have separate bank accounts

5373
02:23:12.660 --> 02:23:13.620
and now let's have a merger.

5374
02:23:14.400 --> 02:23:16.120
Startups are more successful than mergers.

5375
02:23:16.440 --> 02:23:17.880
There's data on that.

5376
02:23:17.960 --> 02:23:18.160
Oh yeah.

5377
02:23:18.160 --> 02:23:19.260
And the worst, of course,

5378
02:23:19.300 --> 02:23:20.900
are hostile takeovers or acquisitions,

5379
02:23:20.900 --> 02:23:21.400
but you know.

5380
02:23:22.160 --> 02:23:22.600
Wow.

5381
02:23:22.820 --> 02:23:23.260
Okay.

5382
02:23:23.780 --> 02:23:25.640
So you can have a merger that works,

5383
02:23:25.960 --> 02:23:27.480
but you got to go into it

5384
02:23:27.480 --> 02:23:28.600
with your eyes open

5385
02:23:28.600 --> 02:23:30.300
and make it as much of a

5386
02:23:30.300 --> 02:23:32.260
startup as you can make.

5387
02:23:32.320 --> 02:23:34.880
And that was, I don't recommend separate

5388
02:23:34.880 --> 02:23:35.380
bank accounts.

5389
02:23:35.880 --> 02:23:37.060
I don't recommend it.

5390
02:23:37.580 --> 02:23:37.680
Really?

5391
02:23:37.840 --> 02:23:37.960
Yeah.

5392
02:23:37.980 --> 02:23:40.280
There's huge data showing that couples

5393
02:23:40.280 --> 02:23:41.260
are more successful

5394
02:23:41.260 --> 02:23:42.780
when they have joint bank accounts.

5395
02:23:43.120 --> 02:23:43.440
Interesting.

5396
02:23:43.520 --> 02:23:44.520
Let me run something by you.

5397
02:23:44.560 --> 02:23:46.200
So when Lisa and I first got together,

5398
02:23:46.740 --> 02:23:49.280
um, we had enough difference in values

5399
02:23:49.280 --> 02:23:50.720
that it was,

5400
02:23:50.860 --> 02:23:52.140
I looked at the things that she

5401
02:23:52.140 --> 02:23:52.920
spent money on

5402
02:23:52.920 --> 02:23:54.040
and I thought they were dumb.

5403
02:23:54.440 --> 02:23:55.680
She looked at the things I spent

5404
02:23:55.680 --> 02:23:56.100
money on.

5405
02:23:56.180 --> 02:23:56.960
She thought they were dumb.

5406
02:23:57.140 --> 02:23:58.520
So what we did was we said,

5407
02:23:58.520 --> 02:23:59.580
bills are joint,

5408
02:23:59.680 --> 02:24:01.600
but spending is separate.

5409
02:24:01.880 --> 02:24:04.780
And so we put our money together

5410
02:24:04.780 --> 02:24:07.160
and then we each had the exact

5411
02:24:07.160 --> 02:24:08.560
same amount to spend.

5412
02:24:09.040 --> 02:24:09.220
Yeah.

5413
02:24:09.360 --> 02:24:11.560
And at the time, so when we

5414
02:24:11.560 --> 02:24:12.020
got married,

5415
02:24:12.120 --> 02:24:14.060
she certainly had more money than me

5416
02:24:14.060 --> 02:24:15.620
because I was just absolutely broken

5417
02:24:15.620 --> 02:24:16.040
in debt.

5418
02:24:16.820 --> 02:24:18.380
But then when we got married, I

5419
02:24:18.380 --> 02:24:19.340
was the only one with a job.

5420
02:24:20.320 --> 02:24:21.860
And the one insight,

5421
02:24:21.940 --> 02:24:23.100
and I wish I could track back

5422
02:24:23.100 --> 02:24:24.560
to where I got this,

5423
02:24:24.740 --> 02:24:26.480
but I was like this,

5424
02:24:26.600 --> 02:24:28.560
cause this is all pre-functional internet.

5425
02:24:28.660 --> 02:24:30.340
The internet existed, but nobody was

5426
02:24:30.340 --> 02:24:32.020
really using it for much.

5427
02:24:33.460 --> 02:24:35.600
And I said, okay, look, we're going

5428
02:24:35.600 --> 02:24:36.440
to come together,

5429
02:24:36.700 --> 02:24:39.120
but the, we're in this together.

5430
02:24:39.220 --> 02:24:40.720
So whatever money I earn, it really

5431
02:24:40.720 --> 02:24:41.460
is half yours.

5432
02:24:41.720 --> 02:24:41.800
Right.

5433
02:24:41.800 --> 02:24:43.580
And so we're going to take care

5434
02:24:43.580 --> 02:24:44.360
of all the bills together.

5435
02:24:44.560 --> 02:24:46.600
We'll have the separate spending accounts

5436
02:24:48.080 --> 02:24:51.080
and really have looked at everything

5437
02:24:51.080 --> 02:24:52.300
in that way.

5438
02:24:52.340 --> 02:24:53.800
Like when we started Impact Theory,

5439
02:24:54.980 --> 02:24:57.060
the lawyers were like, who's going

5440
02:24:57.060 --> 02:24:58.240
to own 51%.

5441
02:24:58.740 --> 02:24:59.680
And I was like, what are you

5442
02:24:59.680 --> 02:25:00.080
talking about?

5443
02:25:00.200 --> 02:25:02.240
And they said, you can't be 50-50.

5444
02:25:02.520 --> 02:25:03.860
That's the ultimate divorce nightmare.

5445
02:25:04.380 --> 02:25:05.320
And so my wife was like,

5446
02:25:05.340 --> 02:25:06.480
you're obviously going to work more

5447
02:25:06.480 --> 02:25:06.920
than me.

5448
02:25:07.000 --> 02:25:08.580
Like you take the 51%.

5449
02:25:08.580 --> 02:25:09.680
She's like, I don't have any problem

5450
02:25:09.680 --> 02:25:10.160
with that whatsoever.

5451
02:25:10.160 --> 02:25:11.760
And I was like, over my dead body,

5452
02:25:12.020 --> 02:25:13.520
I was like, I need you to

5453
02:25:13.520 --> 02:25:15.060
know to the core of your existence,

5454
02:25:15.200 --> 02:25:15.980
this company, whatever.

5455
02:25:17.000 --> 02:25:18.580
If something goes wrong with us, I

5456
02:25:18.580 --> 02:25:19.120
have a problem.

5457
02:25:19.420 --> 02:25:21.940
If we're in a position where I'm like,

5458
02:25:22.120 --> 02:25:23.640
thank God I have 51%.

5459
02:25:23.640 --> 02:25:24.660
I've already lost everything.

5460
02:25:25.740 --> 02:25:26.860
So 50-50.

5461
02:25:26.880 --> 02:25:28.240
Well, all you're saying is Impact Theory

5462
02:25:28.240 --> 02:25:29.620
is an extension of Tom.

5463
02:25:30.500 --> 02:25:32.420
And so therefore my life is 50

5464
02:25:32.420 --> 02:25:33.200
-50 with you.

5465
02:25:33.660 --> 02:25:36.020
So axiomatically Impact Theory is

5466
02:25:36.020 --> 02:25:36.540
50-50.

5467
02:25:36.840 --> 02:25:37.200
Nice.

5468
02:25:38.000 --> 02:25:39.680
And really what I wanted to say was

5469
02:25:39.680 --> 02:25:42.000
Impact Theory is an extension of Tom

5470
02:25:42.000 --> 02:25:42.520
and Lisa.

5471
02:25:42.740 --> 02:25:43.760
Like this is a thing we are

5472
02:25:43.760 --> 02:25:44.780
doing together.

5473
02:25:45.320 --> 02:25:46.940
And even if we weren't,

5474
02:25:47.600 --> 02:25:48.560
I mean, I suppose at that point

5475
02:25:48.560 --> 02:25:49.400
I wouldn't have thought about it.

5476
02:25:49.420 --> 02:25:52.480
But like if my wife betrayed me,

5477
02:25:52.740 --> 02:25:54.120
I'd still give her half my shit.

5478
02:25:54.780 --> 02:25:55.640
I'd just be like, you earned it.

5479
02:25:55.660 --> 02:25:56.200
Yeah, because you love her.

5480
02:25:56.340 --> 02:25:56.680
Yeah, yeah.

5481
02:25:56.840 --> 02:25:58.220
Not only that, I don't know who

5482
02:25:58.220 --> 02:25:59.380
I would have become

5483
02:25:59.380 --> 02:26:02.040
had I not been a startup with her.

5484
02:26:02.220 --> 02:26:03.400
You're not pre-nuppy at all.

5485
02:26:03.600 --> 02:26:05.380
And all you were doing is avoiding fights

5486
02:26:05.380 --> 02:26:07.100
by having separate allowances.

5487
02:26:07.680 --> 02:26:07.820
Yes.

5488
02:26:07.900 --> 02:26:08.920
It's not the same thing.

5489
02:26:09.080 --> 02:26:11.820
I mean, that's just prudent is the

5490
02:26:11.820 --> 02:26:12.440
way that it works out.

5491
02:26:12.480 --> 02:26:13.380
It's like, yeah, we're going to tend

5492
02:26:13.380 --> 02:26:14.180
to fight over this.

5493
02:26:14.640 --> 02:26:17.740
And we don't want me to accidentally

5494
02:26:18.160 --> 02:26:21.080
take all the spending on giant chess pieces

5495
02:26:21.820 --> 02:26:24.040
or Batman statues or something.

5496
02:26:24.200 --> 02:26:24.660
Video games.

5497
02:26:24.880 --> 02:26:26.320
Video games, whatever the thing happens

5498
02:26:26.320 --> 02:26:26.700
to be.

5499
02:26:26.920 --> 02:26:28.880
And so let's make it so we

5500
02:26:28.880 --> 02:26:30.180
just avoid a fight.

5501
02:26:30.220 --> 02:26:31.560
Let's just simply avoid a fight.

5502
02:26:31.780 --> 02:26:33.460
And that way I can laugh at

5503
02:26:33.460 --> 02:26:34.220
the way you spend your money.

5504
02:26:34.220 --> 02:26:35.100
You can laugh at the way I

5505
02:26:35.100 --> 02:26:35.700
spend my money

5506
02:26:35.700 --> 02:26:37.180
instead of feeling a source of resentment.

5507
02:26:37.480 --> 02:26:40.220
But basically saying, my money, your money.

5508
02:26:40.600 --> 02:26:41.980
My account, your account.

5509
02:26:42.140 --> 02:26:43.760
My property, your property.

5510
02:26:43.840 --> 02:26:45.900
That's problematic from the very beginning.

5511
02:26:46.220 --> 02:26:47.560
Because what you're basically is you're

5512
02:26:47.560 --> 02:26:48.200
planning for

5513
02:26:48.200 --> 02:26:49.000
is the dissolution.

5514
02:26:49.660 --> 02:26:51.420
You're planning for the, I mean, it's

5515
02:26:51.420 --> 02:26:51.900
a union.

5516
02:26:52.860 --> 02:26:55.180
And the union of this is to

5517
02:26:55.180 --> 02:26:56.000
say that we're,

5518
02:26:56.460 --> 02:27:00.020
I mean, biblically it's a man shall

5519
02:27:00.020 --> 02:27:01.600
leave his parents

5520
02:27:01.600 --> 02:27:03.440
and cleave to his wife.

5521
02:27:03.880 --> 02:27:05.040
It's one flesh.

5522
02:27:05.200 --> 02:27:07.260
I mean, the whole, in religious traditions,

5523
02:27:07.820 --> 02:27:09.340
divorce is supposed to be like cutting

5524
02:27:09.340 --> 02:27:10.260
off your arm.

5525
02:27:10.980 --> 02:27:12.540
It's supposed to be that kind of,

5526
02:27:13.180 --> 02:27:14.220
I mean, I get it.

5527
02:27:14.260 --> 02:27:15.280
It happens sometimes.

5528
02:27:15.440 --> 02:27:15.760
I get it.

5529
02:27:15.820 --> 02:27:16.840
You know, I live in the real world.

5530
02:27:16.940 --> 02:27:17.920
It happens sometimes.

5531
02:27:18.360 --> 02:27:20.240
But when you're doing it from a startup,

5532
02:27:20.460 --> 02:27:22.080
you don't really understand yourself

5533
02:27:22.080 --> 02:27:22.560
without Lisa.

5534
02:27:23.060 --> 02:27:23.660
It's like, who's Tom?

5535
02:27:23.700 --> 02:27:24.080
I don't know.

5536
02:27:24.380 --> 02:27:24.640
Alone?

5537
02:27:25.900 --> 02:27:26.660
Yeah, that's the thing.

5538
02:27:26.740 --> 02:27:28.020
Now, not everybody can have that.

5539
02:27:28.160 --> 02:27:30.160
You know, and I'm not saying people shouldn't,

5540
02:27:30.220 --> 02:27:32.580
not everybody can be held to these standards

5541
02:27:32.580 --> 02:27:35.840
because of the reality of things that

5542
02:27:35.840 --> 02:27:36.200
have happened

5543
02:27:36.200 --> 02:27:36.860
in their lives.

5544
02:27:37.100 --> 02:27:38.380
And, you know, I talk to people

5545
02:27:38.380 --> 02:27:39.420
who've been the victims

5546
02:27:39.420 --> 02:27:44.780
of abuse and addiction and criminal behavior

5547
02:27:44.780 --> 02:27:45.880
and all of this.

5548
02:27:46.080 --> 02:27:47.560
And they have a need for love

5549
02:27:47.560 --> 02:27:47.980
in their life

5550
02:27:47.980 --> 02:27:48.920
and they get married again

5551
02:27:48.920 --> 02:27:49.980
and they have an established life.

5552
02:27:50.020 --> 02:27:53.400
And it doesn't have these perfect standards.

5553
02:27:53.620 --> 02:27:56.260
Social science gives you the ideal circumstances,

5554
02:27:56.440 --> 02:27:57.860
but not the only circumstances.

5555
02:27:58.420 --> 02:27:59.360
And so here's the key.

5556
02:27:59.680 --> 02:28:01.640
When the circumstances are not ideal,

5557
02:28:02.020 --> 02:28:04.500
you have to work consciously with

5558
02:28:04.500 --> 02:28:05.140
your eyes open

5559
02:28:05.140 --> 02:28:06.480
to make them as ideal as you can.

5560
02:28:06.780 --> 02:28:08.080
So if you've got a merger on

5561
02:28:08.080 --> 02:28:08.420
your hands,

5562
02:28:08.500 --> 02:28:09.380
got a merger on your hands, good.

5563
02:28:09.520 --> 02:28:10.360
You can make that work too,

5564
02:28:10.580 --> 02:28:12.760
but make it as startupy as you can.

5565
02:28:13.260 --> 02:28:15.040
Yeah, the thing I would encourage people

5566
02:28:15.040 --> 02:28:18.160
is to understand that the reason a

5567
02:28:18.160 --> 02:28:18.660
startup works

5568
02:28:18.660 --> 02:28:19.760
is for a set of principles.

5569
02:28:19.900 --> 02:28:20.980
If you understand the principles

5570
02:28:20.980 --> 02:28:23.660
and can apply them later in life,

5571
02:28:23.860 --> 02:28:24.260
so be it.

5572
02:28:24.320 --> 02:28:25.440
One of them is going to be

5573
02:28:25.440 --> 02:28:26.100
being open

5574
02:28:26.100 --> 02:28:29.220
to being changed by the relationship,

5575
02:28:29.220 --> 02:28:31.100
going into it and knowing we are

5576
02:28:31.100 --> 02:28:32.320
creating a union.

5577
02:28:32.800 --> 02:28:34.960
And in doing that, like what are

5578
02:28:34.960 --> 02:28:35.540
the ways

5579
02:28:35.540 --> 02:28:37.020
that we have to move and to

5580
02:28:37.020 --> 02:28:38.200
dance in this thing

5581
02:28:38.200 --> 02:28:39.240
in order to make it work?

5582
02:28:39.540 --> 02:28:40.700
And then a big part of it,

5583
02:28:40.800 --> 02:28:42.160
especially if you're older

5584
02:28:42.160 --> 02:28:45.180
is understanding that selection is

5585
02:28:45.180 --> 02:28:46.180
80% of the battle.

5586
02:28:46.280 --> 02:28:48.060
Like if you select poorly,

5587
02:28:48.700 --> 02:28:51.520
you're going to be in dire circumstances.

5588
02:28:51.900 --> 02:28:52.620
There are.

5589
02:28:52.720 --> 02:28:55.300
I mean, again, without magical thinking,

5590
02:28:55.440 --> 02:28:57.300
without thinking there is one soulmate.

5591
02:28:57.360 --> 02:28:58.840
So choose wisely.

5592
02:28:59.220 --> 02:29:01.280
I don't believe in soulmates.

5593
02:29:01.480 --> 02:29:02.460
I don't believe in love at first sight.

5594
02:29:02.600 --> 02:29:05.240
I'm just saying that if, for instance,

5595
02:29:05.820 --> 02:29:07.300
you said earlier, you have to grow

5596
02:29:07.300 --> 02:29:08.180
together as a couple.

5597
02:29:08.720 --> 02:29:11.600
Now the amount of all the things

5598
02:29:11.600 --> 02:29:14.180
that we talked about here, emotional stability,

5599
02:29:14.500 --> 02:29:15.920
getting that right, knowing how to

5600
02:29:15.920 --> 02:29:16.360
fight well.

5601
02:29:16.560 --> 02:29:17.820
Like, I mean, there's just a laundry list

5602
02:29:17.820 --> 02:29:20.580
of happiness things that if you get right,

5603
02:29:20.660 --> 02:29:22.740
you will be way prime for a marriage.

5604
02:29:23.100 --> 02:29:25.180
Knowledge is power in your relationships,

5605
02:29:25.360 --> 02:29:27.200
in your work, in your spiritual life.

5606
02:29:27.280 --> 02:29:28.100
Knowledge is power.

5607
02:29:28.100 --> 02:29:30.660
And again, it all goes back to,

5608
02:29:30.740 --> 02:29:32.800
I know people who say, yeah, we

5609
02:29:32.800 --> 02:29:33.780
knew each other for a week

5610
02:29:33.780 --> 02:29:34.860
and we got married in Vegas.

5611
02:29:34.980 --> 02:29:36.440
It's like, that's folly.

5612
02:29:37.160 --> 02:29:38.420
That's just serendipity.

5613
02:29:38.980 --> 02:29:41.140
That just doesn't make sense.

5614
02:29:41.240 --> 02:29:42.960
On the other hand, when somebody says,

5615
02:29:43.060 --> 02:29:43.200
I say,

5616
02:29:43.240 --> 02:29:44.180
how long have you been dating that girl?

5617
02:29:44.280 --> 02:29:44.960
It's like eight years.

5618
02:29:45.060 --> 02:29:47.220
It's like, no, no, no.

5619
02:29:50.180 --> 02:29:51.480
And what's the right amount of time?

5620
02:29:51.560 --> 02:29:53.660
This is a question of prudential judgment too.

5621
02:29:53.660 --> 02:29:58.100
My oldest son met his wife, now wife,

5622
02:29:58.320 --> 02:30:02.460
when he was 24, early 24.

5623
02:30:03.420 --> 02:30:04.800
They dated for six months.

5624
02:30:05.060 --> 02:30:06.540
They were engaged for six months.

5625
02:30:07.120 --> 02:30:08.880
They got married a year after they

5626
02:30:08.880 --> 02:30:09.440
started dating.

5627
02:30:10.120 --> 02:30:11.640
Their first child was born nine months later.

5628
02:30:11.860 --> 02:30:13.360
I mean, that's called the 6-6

5629
02:30:13.360 --> 02:30:13.980
-9 cadence

5630
02:30:13.980 --> 02:30:15.100
in Catholic life, by the way.

5631
02:30:15.680 --> 02:30:16.300
Six, really?

5632
02:30:16.420 --> 02:30:16.960
That's a thing?

5633
02:30:17.040 --> 02:30:17.460
That's a thing.

5634
02:30:17.620 --> 02:30:19.320
Six months dating, six months engaged,

5635
02:30:19.500 --> 02:30:20.480
nine months till the first baby.

5636
02:30:21.180 --> 02:30:23.200
I mean, it's not that we recommend this.

5637
02:30:23.200 --> 02:30:24.960
But it worked out really, really well

5638
02:30:24.960 --> 02:30:26.460
because that was enough time, but

5639
02:30:26.460 --> 02:30:27.540
it wasn't too much.

5640
02:30:28.320 --> 02:30:29.220
You know, it wasn't the kind of

5641
02:30:29.220 --> 02:30:29.920
thing where, I don't know,

5642
02:30:29.980 --> 02:30:31.660
why don't we live together for, you know,

5643
02:30:31.700 --> 02:30:33.020
50 years before we decide whether

5644
02:30:33.020 --> 02:30:33.680
or not to get married.

5645
02:30:33.760 --> 02:30:35.400
That's not the right thing either.

5646
02:30:35.600 --> 02:30:36.980
So, you know, prudential judgment is,

5647
02:30:37.920 --> 02:30:39.020
and it's the same thing with a

5648
02:30:39.020 --> 02:30:39.900
startup, by the way.

5649
02:30:40.120 --> 02:30:41.160
I don't know, I think I need

5650
02:30:41.160 --> 02:30:42.460
a little bit more experience.

5651
02:30:42.760 --> 02:30:43.780
So when I was writing my dissertation,

5652
02:30:44.120 --> 02:30:45.360
I would see these guys and, you know,

5653
02:30:45.400 --> 02:30:46.480
I was doing my PhD with like,

5654
02:30:46.800 --> 02:30:48.520
I got to read a couple more books.

5655
02:30:48.520 --> 02:30:53.140
Write your dissertation, pop the question

5656
02:30:53.140 --> 02:30:55.280
after a certain point, but not on

5657
02:30:55.280 --> 02:30:55.700
the first date.

5658
02:30:56.020 --> 02:30:57.940
Yeah, I didn't have any trouble with that.

5659
02:30:58.180 --> 02:31:00.100
So for me, when I met Lisa,

5660
02:31:00.100 --> 02:31:01.160
I did not think I was going

5661
02:31:01.160 --> 02:31:01.720
to get married.

5662
02:31:02.960 --> 02:31:05.000
And then I was 24.

5663
02:31:06.140 --> 02:31:08.060
And when we started dating,

5664
02:31:09.200 --> 02:31:11.480
probably about three months in something,

5665
02:31:11.660 --> 02:31:12.980
three, four months in something like that,

5666
02:31:13.000 --> 02:31:14.460
I realized, oh shit, like I'm in

5667
02:31:14.460 --> 02:31:15.000
love with her.

5668
02:31:15.340 --> 02:31:16.800
And then I was like, okay, well,

5669
02:31:16.800 --> 02:31:18.940
I'm either never getting married

5670
02:31:18.940 --> 02:31:20.780
or I'm marrying this woman.

5671
02:31:22.080 --> 02:31:24.340
And so I proposed at eight months

5672
02:31:24.340 --> 02:31:25.880
and we had spent some of those

5673
02:31:25.880 --> 02:31:26.620
eight months apart.

5674
02:31:26.780 --> 02:31:27.960
So it wasn't even like we were

5675
02:31:27.960 --> 02:31:28.440
living together

5676
02:31:28.440 --> 02:31:29.260
for eight months or anything

5677
02:31:29.260 --> 02:31:30.400
because she was in England.

5678
02:31:31.660 --> 02:31:34.080
And then I was ready to get

5679
02:31:34.080 --> 02:31:34.700
married right away.

5680
02:31:34.760 --> 02:31:35.960
I was like, what's it take to

5681
02:31:35.960 --> 02:31:36.480
get married

5682
02:31:36.480 --> 02:31:37.420
about three months?

5683
02:31:37.420 --> 02:31:39.660
And she's like, you are having a laugh.

5684
02:31:39.740 --> 02:31:40.860
She's like, no way, this is going

5685
02:31:40.860 --> 02:31:41.180
to take

5686
02:31:41.180 --> 02:31:42.720
like a year to plan this wedding.

5687
02:31:43.220 --> 02:31:45.620
So we ended up being together for

5688
02:31:45.620 --> 02:31:46.640
about 18 months,

5689
02:31:46.640 --> 02:31:47.920
by the time we got married.

5690
02:31:48.680 --> 02:31:49.520
But it was-

5691
02:31:49.520 --> 02:31:50.180
Good and fast, that's good.

5692
02:31:50.320 --> 02:31:51.740
By today's standards, that's fast.

5693
02:31:52.040 --> 02:31:53.380
And by today's standards, you were young.

5694
02:31:53.680 --> 02:31:53.800
Yeah.

5695
02:31:54.960 --> 02:31:57.560
And again, society changes in different ways,

5696
02:31:57.660 --> 02:31:59.840
but some of these principles don't change.

5697
02:32:00.060 --> 02:32:01.200
I don't know if any of the

5698
02:32:01.200 --> 02:32:02.260
principles change.

5699
02:32:02.380 --> 02:32:03.160
That's the thing, like-

5700
02:32:03.160 --> 02:32:04.640
Circumstances do, but principles don't.

5701
02:32:04.680 --> 02:32:04.920
Yeah.

5702
02:32:05.020 --> 02:32:07.380
So how do people grow together?

5703
02:32:07.500 --> 02:32:09.300
Like what is the key there?

5704
02:32:10.220 --> 02:32:12.880
Part of it is understanding that you

5705
02:32:12.880 --> 02:32:14.300
are stronger

5706
02:32:14.300 --> 02:32:15.340
when you are together.

5707
02:32:15.340 --> 02:32:17.280
And that one of the cues for

5708
02:32:17.280 --> 02:32:17.880
you to change

5709
02:32:17.880 --> 02:32:19.020
is the other person changing.

5710
02:32:19.520 --> 02:32:21.780
So not, people who struggle,

5711
02:32:22.040 --> 02:32:23.520
they think the cue for me to

5712
02:32:23.520 --> 02:32:24.140
do something different

5713
02:32:24.140 --> 02:32:25.720
in my life is I feel differently

5714
02:32:25.720 --> 02:32:26.360
about something.

5715
02:32:26.460 --> 02:32:27.540
One of the cues for you to

5716
02:32:27.540 --> 02:32:28.280
do something differently

5717
02:32:28.280 --> 02:32:30.020
in your life is that your spouse

5718
02:32:30.020 --> 02:32:30.720
starts to think,

5719
02:32:31.200 --> 02:32:32.380
feel differently about that.

5720
02:32:32.640 --> 02:32:34.820
You have to take on the characteristics

5721
02:32:34.820 --> 02:32:36.160
of the other person as if they

5722
02:32:36.160 --> 02:32:37.120
were inside you.

5723
02:32:37.960 --> 02:32:39.320
You know, so you find, for example,

5724
02:32:39.360 --> 02:32:41.920
that your spouse is on a spiritual journey,

5725
02:32:42.000 --> 02:32:44.020
starts to find stirrings of spirituality.

5726
02:32:44.460 --> 02:32:45.560
That's a cue for you to do

5727
02:32:45.560 --> 02:32:45.900
that too.

5728
02:32:46.280 --> 02:32:47.420
That's a cue for you to do

5729
02:32:47.420 --> 02:32:47.820
that too.

5730
02:32:47.980 --> 02:32:49.600
And to do that sincerely as well.

5731
02:32:49.800 --> 02:32:51.100
And again, people say, well, you're losing

5732
02:32:51.100 --> 02:32:52.620
your individuality and the whole thing.

5733
02:32:52.660 --> 02:32:54.320
Yep, that's exactly right.

5734
02:32:54.780 --> 02:32:55.080
Yep.

5735
02:32:56.160 --> 02:32:58.040
Yeah, you're sublimating the individuality

5736
02:32:58.040 --> 02:32:59.800
on these things to have greater strength

5737
02:32:59.800 --> 02:33:01.620
in the union, right?

5738
02:33:01.620 --> 02:33:04.140
So that you can have a greater multiplicity

5739
02:33:04.140 --> 02:33:05.760
of experiences across the two of you.

5740
02:33:07.400 --> 02:33:09.240
Greater adventure and excitement across

5741
02:33:09.240 --> 02:33:09.840
the two of you

5742
02:33:09.840 --> 02:33:10.980
is a way that that works.

5743
02:33:11.020 --> 02:33:12.200
And sometimes it's hard for people

5744
02:33:12.200 --> 02:33:13.540
because they feel that they're the

5745
02:33:13.540 --> 02:33:14.360
senior partner

5746
02:33:14.360 --> 02:33:15.040
in the relationship.

5747
02:33:16.120 --> 02:33:18.120
That's not the secret to a successful marriage.

5748
02:33:18.320 --> 02:33:20.120
Now, there are social scientists

5749
02:33:20.120 --> 02:33:21.980
that have very heterodox views on this.

5750
02:33:22.020 --> 02:33:24.040
There's a guy named Eli Finkel at Northwestern,

5751
02:33:25.000 --> 02:33:27.300
a psychologist who's written about marriage.

5752
02:33:27.520 --> 02:33:28.900
And he says that one of the reasons

5753
02:33:28.900 --> 02:33:30.540
that marriage is so hard today

5754
02:33:30.540 --> 02:33:33.180
is because we expect too much from it.

5755
02:33:33.680 --> 02:33:35.200
He says, you know, we expect your

5756
02:33:35.200 --> 02:33:35.780
best friend

5757
02:33:35.780 --> 02:33:38.160
and your one and only lover

5758
02:33:38.160 --> 02:33:39.820
and your business partner

5759
02:33:39.820 --> 02:33:41.240
and the person who helps you raise

5760
02:33:41.240 --> 02:33:41.800
your kids.

5761
02:33:41.800 --> 02:33:44.460
The only person who knows your secrets.

5762
02:33:44.580 --> 02:33:46.680
And it's like, it's too much pressure

5763
02:33:46.680 --> 02:33:48.100
for one relationship

5764
02:33:48.100 --> 02:33:50.740
that was distributed across 10 people

5765
02:33:50.740 --> 02:33:53.020
until about the 19th century or the

5766
02:33:53.020 --> 02:33:53.700
20th century.

5767
02:33:53.880 --> 02:33:56.860
But in the time of the romantic era,

5768
02:33:58.040 --> 02:34:02.980
where when romance took on its modern connotations,

5769
02:34:03.060 --> 02:34:05.080
which is it's everything, it's magic.

5770
02:34:05.760 --> 02:34:08.480
It's, you know, it simulates the relationship

5771
02:34:08.480 --> 02:34:09.260
with God.

5772
02:34:09.260 --> 02:34:10.300
Even some of the language

5773
02:34:10.300 --> 02:34:11.660
that we've used in this conversation,

5774
02:34:12.300 --> 02:34:14.080
that then it took on too much pressure.

5775
02:34:14.740 --> 02:34:16.880
And he recommends in his book about this,

5776
02:34:17.100 --> 02:34:18.020
that and in his work and his

5777
02:34:18.020 --> 02:34:19.540
very interesting research,

5778
02:34:20.000 --> 02:34:22.220
that you ease off on the throttle

5779
02:34:22.220 --> 02:34:23.080
a little bit.

5780
02:34:23.200 --> 02:34:25.000
That you don't expect your wife

5781
02:34:25.000 --> 02:34:26.520
to be your best friend necessarily.

5782
02:34:26.800 --> 02:34:28.080
He even suggests that some couples

5783
02:34:28.080 --> 02:34:28.420
do better

5784
02:34:28.420 --> 02:34:29.780
when they're not the only exclusive

5785
02:34:29.780 --> 02:34:30.420
sexual partner.

5786
02:34:30.680 --> 02:34:31.460
I disagree with that.

5787
02:34:32.440 --> 02:34:33.340
I disagree with that.

5788
02:34:33.420 --> 02:34:35.440
I don't think the data support that.

5789
02:34:35.520 --> 02:34:37.540
I mean, again, as they say in finance,

5790
02:34:37.580 --> 02:34:38.500
your results may differ.

5791
02:34:39.060 --> 02:34:40.740
But they certainly don't in my case

5792
02:34:40.740 --> 02:34:41.140
or yours.

5793
02:34:41.440 --> 02:34:43.720
Yeah, that one I can't imagine.

5794
02:34:43.880 --> 02:34:46.300
Having unshared sexual experience.

5795
02:34:46.360 --> 02:34:47.620
The only thing that I can imagine

5796
02:34:47.620 --> 02:34:48.600
is if, yay,

5797
02:34:48.800 --> 02:34:50.780
if you're like sharing something by

5798
02:34:50.780 --> 02:34:51.140
all means.

5799
02:34:51.560 --> 02:34:53.620
But when people go off, I just

5800
02:34:53.620 --> 02:34:54.880
don't see how that works.

5801
02:34:54.920 --> 02:34:57.320
And I certainly don't see how it works

5802
02:34:57.320 --> 02:34:59.220
if you invite another person into

5803
02:34:59.220 --> 02:35:00.460
the stable pair bond.

5804
02:35:00.900 --> 02:35:01.620
Like, whoa.

5805
02:35:01.840 --> 02:35:02.220
I know.

5806
02:35:02.360 --> 02:35:04.660
And there's actually, you as an evolution guy,

5807
02:35:04.780 --> 02:35:06.320
you'll really, really like this literature

5808
02:35:06.320 --> 02:35:08.340
that talks about why it screws up relationships.

5809
02:35:09.140 --> 02:35:11.080
So there's a guy at University of Texas

5810
02:35:11.080 --> 02:35:12.300
that does work on jealousy,

5811
02:35:12.680 --> 02:35:14.800
on the evolutionary basis of jealousy.

5812
02:35:14.980 --> 02:35:16.160
And he had this hypothesis

5813
02:35:16.780 --> 02:35:20.760
that men are more jealous of sexual infidelity.

5814
02:35:21.280 --> 02:35:24.380
And women are more jealous of emotional infidelity.

5815
02:35:24.900 --> 02:35:26.260
And so what he does is he

5816
02:35:26.260 --> 02:35:29.520
finds that women in relationships,

5817
02:35:29.920 --> 02:35:32.100
they will forgive their husbands for

5818
02:35:32.100 --> 02:35:32.940
sexual discretions,

5819
02:35:33.040 --> 02:35:34.260
but not for falling in love with

5820
02:35:34.260 --> 02:35:34.800
another woman.

5821
02:35:34.800 --> 02:35:37.380
And a man, if your wife says,

5822
02:35:38.260 --> 02:35:40.440
I mean, yeah, I had an affair,

5823
02:35:40.700 --> 02:35:41.280
all that.

5824
02:35:41.620 --> 02:35:42.940
But it was only because I felt

5825
02:35:42.940 --> 02:35:43.740
like I was falling in love.

5826
02:35:43.820 --> 02:35:44.620
The sex was terrible.

5827
02:35:44.760 --> 02:35:45.880
You'd be like, I forgive you.

5828
02:35:46.140 --> 02:35:46.460
Yeah, yeah.

5829
02:35:46.560 --> 02:35:47.100
I forgive you.

5830
02:35:47.220 --> 02:35:49.040
It's so asymmetrically weird.

5831
02:35:49.080 --> 02:35:50.140
And the reason for this from an

5832
02:35:50.140 --> 02:35:50.880
evolutionary basis

5833
02:35:50.880 --> 02:35:54.940
is that males have to be really vigilant

5834
02:35:54.940 --> 02:35:56.920
about making sure they're not inadvertently

5835
02:35:56.920 --> 02:35:58.760
raising the offspring of another male.

5836
02:35:59.040 --> 02:35:59.200
Yeah.

5837
02:35:59.300 --> 02:36:01.020
And women have to be very vigilant

5838
02:36:01.020 --> 02:36:01.620
to make sure

5839
02:36:01.620 --> 02:36:03.540
that the provider and defender of

5840
02:36:03.540 --> 02:36:03.880
the family

5841
02:36:03.880 --> 02:36:05.740
doesn't stray and take and defend

5842
02:36:05.740 --> 02:36:06.880
and provide for another family

5843
02:36:06.880 --> 02:36:08.920
and another female's offspring.

5844
02:36:09.640 --> 02:36:11.620
And so that's why the jealousy

5845
02:36:11.620 --> 02:36:13.040
is gonna work in that particular way.

5846
02:36:13.120 --> 02:36:14.120
But no matter what, I'm telling you,

5847
02:36:14.220 --> 02:36:16.340
if you have an open marriage,

5848
02:36:17.540 --> 02:36:19.920
somebody's gonna fall in love, you know?

5849
02:36:19.980 --> 02:36:21.780
And there's all kinds of stuff that

5850
02:36:21.780 --> 02:36:23.120
can go wrong on that.

5851
02:36:23.220 --> 02:36:24.500
So that's not, I mean, again,

5852
02:36:24.680 --> 02:36:26.560
it's like different social scientists

5853
02:36:26.560 --> 02:36:27.300
disagree on that.

5854
02:36:27.380 --> 02:36:28.640
But I think my reading of the data

5855
02:36:28.640 --> 02:36:29.700
and my prudential judgment,

5856
02:36:30.120 --> 02:36:31.680
not just my Catholicism suggests

5857
02:36:31.680 --> 02:36:32.900
that that's not a wise course of

5858
02:36:32.900 --> 02:36:33.540
action for most.

5859
02:36:33.540 --> 02:36:34.660
I'm a big believer.

5860
02:36:34.820 --> 02:36:35.780
I think you're right about that.

5861
02:36:36.040 --> 02:36:37.280
I'm a big believer in what I

5862
02:36:37.280 --> 02:36:38.460
call frame of reference.

5863
02:36:38.660 --> 02:36:39.600
So your frame of reference

5864
02:36:39.600 --> 02:36:42.220
or your set of beliefs and your values.

5865
02:36:42.620 --> 02:36:42.700
Right.

5866
02:36:43.220 --> 02:36:44.760
There's other things at the fringes,

5867
02:36:44.860 --> 02:36:46.360
but that's the core of it.

5868
02:36:46.540 --> 02:36:48.820
And it will make all the difference.

5869
02:36:48.960 --> 02:36:50.200
It's not what happens,

5870
02:36:50.240 --> 02:36:51.320
it's how you perceive what happens,

5871
02:36:51.340 --> 02:36:52.980
just going back to Viktor Frankl.

5872
02:36:53.720 --> 02:36:55.200
So to that point,

5873
02:36:55.300 --> 02:36:56.960
you said guys have to be really

5874
02:36:56.960 --> 02:36:57.660
hyper protective

5875
02:36:57.660 --> 02:36:58.680
that they're not raising somebody

5876
02:36:58.680 --> 02:36:59.160
else's kid,

5877
02:36:59.180 --> 02:37:00.220
but you adopted a kid.

5878
02:37:00.340 --> 02:37:00.500
Right.

5879
02:37:00.820 --> 02:37:02.020
And so that to me speaks to

5880
02:37:02.020 --> 02:37:02.760
frame of reference.

5881
02:37:02.760 --> 02:37:04.060
And I've heard you say that you

5882
02:37:04.060 --> 02:37:05.100
have every bit of love

5883
02:37:05.100 --> 02:37:06.160
for your adopted daughter

5884
02:37:06.160 --> 02:37:07.640
that you have for your biological kids,

5885
02:37:07.700 --> 02:37:08.580
which I have no reason to believe

5886
02:37:08.580 --> 02:37:09.260
is not true.

5887
02:37:09.660 --> 02:37:12.060
So what did you do to your

5888
02:37:12.060 --> 02:37:12.820
frame of reference

5889
02:37:12.820 --> 02:37:14.840
in order to be able to welcome her?

5890
02:37:14.920 --> 02:37:16.580
And even though we would both agree

5891
02:37:16.580 --> 02:37:18.020
that from an evolutionary standpoint,

5892
02:37:18.080 --> 02:37:18.760
that doesn't make sense.

5893
02:37:18.980 --> 02:37:19.200
Yeah.

5894
02:37:19.400 --> 02:37:19.840
It will.

5895
02:37:20.040 --> 02:37:20.180
Yeah.

5896
02:37:20.200 --> 02:37:21.460
From an evolutionary standpoint,

5897
02:37:21.580 --> 02:37:22.880
it actually might make sense

5898
02:37:22.880 --> 02:37:23.840
from an evolutionary standpoint,

5899
02:37:23.840 --> 02:37:25.460
because if there's an orphan,

5900
02:37:25.700 --> 02:37:27.540
even in nature will be adopted

5901
02:37:28.500 --> 02:37:30.460
by non-human mammals,

5902
02:37:31.060 --> 02:37:31.900
will adopt orphans.

5903
02:37:32.460 --> 02:37:33.220
As their own.

5904
02:37:33.620 --> 02:37:35.520
And sometimes it will be even a mistake.

5905
02:37:35.660 --> 02:37:38.800
So you see the cuckoo bird

5906
02:37:38.800 --> 02:37:40.240
will actually lay its eggs

5907
02:37:40.240 --> 02:37:41.520
in the nest of other birds.

5908
02:37:41.840 --> 02:37:43.040
And then the egg,

5909
02:37:43.280 --> 02:37:44.620
knock the eggs out of the nest

5910
02:37:44.620 --> 02:37:46.620
of the other of the birds

5911
02:37:47.380 --> 02:37:48.460
that have the nest.

5912
02:37:48.500 --> 02:37:50.260
And then the cuckoo will hatch

5913
02:37:50.260 --> 02:37:52.640
and be taken care of by the

5914
02:37:52.640 --> 02:37:53.240
surrogate mother.

5915
02:37:53.640 --> 02:37:55.280
That's where the name cuckold comes from.

5916
02:37:55.420 --> 02:37:56.080
Yeah, exactly right.

5917
02:37:56.200 --> 02:37:57.220
And then of course,

5918
02:37:57.260 --> 02:37:58.580
the cuckoo is twice the size,

5919
02:37:58.820 --> 02:37:59.320
the regular bird.

5920
02:37:59.400 --> 02:38:00.440
So it's hilarious because,

5921
02:38:00.440 --> 02:38:00.760
you know,

5922
02:38:01.180 --> 02:38:06.460
the baby bird is the funniest thing.

5923
02:38:06.680 --> 02:38:09.140
So there is some evolutionary basis

5924
02:38:09.140 --> 02:38:09.800
for that

5925
02:38:09.800 --> 02:38:11.520
in the case of not raising

5926
02:38:11.520 --> 02:38:12.820
somebody else's offspring per se,

5927
02:38:12.920 --> 02:38:13.600
but raising an orphan

5928
02:38:13.600 --> 02:38:15.580
and bringing the child into your own family.

5929
02:38:15.700 --> 02:38:16.820
And one of the things that you find

5930
02:38:16.820 --> 02:38:18.720
is that my experience,

5931
02:38:18.860 --> 02:38:20.140
but also the research shows

5932
02:38:20.140 --> 02:38:21.520
that the oxytocin release

5933
02:38:21.520 --> 02:38:22.840
for an adopted child

5934
02:38:22.840 --> 02:38:23.820
is just as high as it is

5935
02:38:23.820 --> 02:38:24.700
for a biological child.

5936
02:38:24.960 --> 02:38:26.080
So you basically know

5937
02:38:26.080 --> 02:38:27.120
that this is my child.

5938
02:38:27.220 --> 02:38:28.240
You lay eyes on that child

5939
02:38:28.240 --> 02:38:30.760
and it's 4th of July all over.

5940
02:38:30.840 --> 02:38:31.840
There's Roman candles in your head.

5941
02:38:32.640 --> 02:38:33.680
And it is forever.

5942
02:38:34.480 --> 02:38:35.300
And so it's funny

5943
02:38:35.300 --> 02:38:37.480
because you don't actually know

5944
02:38:37.480 --> 02:38:38.120
till you do it.

5945
02:38:38.720 --> 02:38:39.660
It's all a theory.

5946
02:38:40.200 --> 02:38:41.580
Oh yeah, no, you know,

5947
02:38:41.600 --> 02:38:43.080
the bond with the adopted child

5948
02:38:43.080 --> 02:38:43.780
will be just as much

5949
02:38:43.780 --> 02:38:44.960
as with the biological child.

5950
02:38:45.940 --> 02:38:47.660
It's weird because intellectually,

5951
02:38:48.440 --> 02:38:50.700
it's a stronger bond in some ways

5952
02:38:50.700 --> 02:38:52.720
because it's this election,

5953
02:38:53.040 --> 02:38:54.340
it's this human will

5954
02:38:54.340 --> 02:38:57.340
on top of the neurophysiology

5955
02:38:57.340 --> 02:38:59.520
of human connection on top of it.

5956
02:38:59.520 --> 02:39:00.140
It's really something.

5957
02:39:00.360 --> 02:39:01.200
I have to say it's funny.

5958
02:39:01.760 --> 02:39:03.540
It's funny, but it's just deep, deep,

5959
02:39:03.640 --> 02:39:04.380
deep, deep love.

5960
02:39:04.900 --> 02:39:07.080
And for both kinds of kids.

5961
02:39:08.020 --> 02:39:08.920
It's really interesting.

5962
02:39:09.080 --> 02:39:09.780
Speaking of kids,

5963
02:39:09.920 --> 02:39:12.560
how does a good Catholic

5964
02:39:12.560 --> 02:39:13.820
end up with a son

5965
02:39:13.820 --> 02:39:14.580
who becomes a sniper?

5966
02:39:16.020 --> 02:39:17.180
Yeah, there've been a lot of good,

5967
02:39:17.180 --> 02:39:19.020
good service members in the Marine Corps,

5968
02:39:19.220 --> 02:39:20.840
but my son, Carlos, it's interesting.

5969
02:39:21.020 --> 02:39:21.480
So I used to,

5970
02:39:24.460 --> 02:39:26.220
my approach with my kids

5971
02:39:26.220 --> 02:39:28.180
has been given that life is a startup,

5972
02:39:29.240 --> 02:39:30.400
they need a business plan.

5973
02:39:31.760 --> 02:39:33.640
And I need a business plan from them

5974
02:39:33.640 --> 02:39:35.680
because I'm VC, right?

5975
02:39:35.840 --> 02:39:37.380
And I deserve a good business plan.

5976
02:39:37.700 --> 02:39:38.940
And so I had my kids write

5977
02:39:38.940 --> 02:39:39.940
business plans in high school.

5978
02:39:40.040 --> 02:39:41.300
And when they were not original

5979
02:39:41.300 --> 02:39:42.220
or no good, I'd send it back

5980
02:39:42.220 --> 02:39:42.860
for revisions.

5981
02:39:43.600 --> 02:39:44.620
And Carlos's business plan

5982
02:39:44.620 --> 02:39:46.340
had like six rounds of revisions.

5983
02:39:46.640 --> 02:39:48.140
The first one was very unoriginal.

5984
02:39:48.280 --> 02:39:49.460
He was not a motivated student

5985
02:39:49.460 --> 02:39:49.880
in high school.

5986
02:39:50.520 --> 02:39:51.320
It was always like,

5987
02:39:52.280 --> 02:39:54.540
you know, he's getting a C in history.

5988
02:39:54.680 --> 02:39:55.820
He's getting a D in Latin.

5989
02:39:55.820 --> 02:39:58.120
And he's clear.

5990
02:39:58.400 --> 02:40:01.320
He was not cut out for college.

5991
02:40:02.000 --> 02:40:02.760
And when it came time,

5992
02:40:03.040 --> 02:40:04.700
he got a big athletic scholarship.

5993
02:40:04.860 --> 02:40:06.600
He's a great, big, healthy, strapping,

5994
02:40:06.900 --> 02:40:08.060
coordinated athletic boy.

5995
02:40:09.980 --> 02:40:12.500
But I said, in this business plan,

5996
02:40:12.560 --> 02:40:13.780
you need something more original than that.

5997
02:40:14.340 --> 02:40:15.060
I'm an academic,

5998
02:40:15.340 --> 02:40:16.540
so this isn't breaking my heart.

5999
02:40:16.980 --> 02:40:17.340
But, you know,

6000
02:40:17.640 --> 02:40:19.180
so finally he comes back and he says,

6001
02:40:20.280 --> 02:40:22.080
part of it is because your business plan

6002
02:40:22.080 --> 02:40:24.180
as a kid has to answer two questions,

6003
02:40:24.280 --> 02:40:25.600
by the way, as an adult too.

6004
02:40:25.820 --> 02:40:29.440
The meaning requires that you have

6005
02:40:29.440 --> 02:40:30.800
answers to two questions.

6006
02:40:30.920 --> 02:40:32.120
This is the diagnostic test.

6007
02:40:32.640 --> 02:40:33.500
Why are you alive?

6008
02:40:33.760 --> 02:40:35.100
And for what are you willing to

6009
02:40:35.100 --> 02:40:35.760
die today?

6010
02:40:36.140 --> 02:40:38.180
If you don't have answers to those questions,

6011
02:40:38.240 --> 02:40:39.300
you have a meaning crisis.

6012
02:40:39.960 --> 02:40:41.380
I don't know what your answers are,

6013
02:40:41.480 --> 02:40:42.660
but you have to have real answers,

6014
02:40:42.800 --> 02:40:44.800
not BS answers, not nonsense answers.

6015
02:40:44.800 --> 02:40:45.500
How old were they when you started

6016
02:40:45.500 --> 02:40:46.180
asking this question?

6017
02:40:46.180 --> 02:40:46.520
High school.

6018
02:40:47.040 --> 02:40:48.200
So like junior year in high school.

6019
02:40:48.680 --> 02:40:49.700
And he didn't have answers.

6020
02:40:50.780 --> 02:40:51.840
So where are you going to go

6021
02:40:51.840 --> 02:40:52.420
find the answers?

6022
02:40:52.620 --> 02:40:53.980
And he had a very good answer

6023
02:40:53.980 --> 02:40:55.800
to the question of how to find

6024
02:40:55.800 --> 02:40:56.220
the answers,

6025
02:40:56.900 --> 02:40:59.120
which was, I want to go work hard

6026
02:40:59.120 --> 02:41:00.240
with my hands outdoors.

6027
02:41:00.520 --> 02:41:01.340
Why do you think that was a

6028
02:41:01.340 --> 02:41:01.720
good answer?

6029
02:41:01.980 --> 02:41:03.580
Because I believe that that was the

6030
02:41:03.580 --> 02:41:04.260
case for him.

6031
02:41:04.520 --> 02:41:05.880
He's a very kinetic boy.

6032
02:41:06.560 --> 02:41:08.060
You know, he was a kid who,

6033
02:41:08.780 --> 02:41:10.960
he had a strong,

6034
02:41:11.920 --> 02:41:13.500
an affinity for the outdoors,

6035
02:41:14.160 --> 02:41:15.240
fishing, hunting,

6036
02:41:15.580 --> 02:41:16.580
which is not in our family.

6037
02:41:16.780 --> 02:41:17.440
You know, I didn't grow up.

6038
02:41:17.560 --> 02:41:19.740
I used to go fishing every year

6039
02:41:19.740 --> 02:41:20.440
in Lincoln City

6040
02:41:20.440 --> 02:41:22.420
on the Oregon coast when I was

6041
02:41:22.420 --> 02:41:22.840
a kid.

6042
02:41:23.040 --> 02:41:23.600
And, you know, that kind of thing.

6043
02:41:24.020 --> 02:41:24.380
Outdoorsman.

6044
02:41:24.520 --> 02:41:25.420
My dad was a professor, right?

6045
02:41:25.600 --> 02:41:27.280
And so, but he was really into it.

6046
02:41:27.320 --> 02:41:28.800
He's good at that whole thing.

6047
02:41:28.860 --> 02:41:30.500
So he took a job as a

6048
02:41:30.500 --> 02:41:31.760
dry land wheat farmer

6049
02:41:31.760 --> 02:41:33.240
up in Idaho in Grangeville

6050
02:41:33.240 --> 02:41:35.400
and worked two harvests, made a bunch

6051
02:41:35.400 --> 02:41:35.680
of money.

6052
02:41:35.780 --> 02:41:37.140
He was alone all the time with

6053
02:41:37.140 --> 02:41:37.600
his thoughts.

6054
02:41:37.720 --> 02:41:39.140
He was digging rocks out of the soil

6055
02:41:39.140 --> 02:41:40.360
and mending fences and driving.

6056
02:41:40.360 --> 02:41:42.380
Was he making it spiritual for himself

6057
02:41:42.380 --> 02:41:44.000
or did just the nature of it?

6058
02:41:44.000 --> 02:41:44.880
He was going to church.

6059
02:41:45.120 --> 02:41:46.380
I mean, he was always kind of

6060
02:41:46.380 --> 02:41:47.200
half-heartedly,

6061
02:41:47.440 --> 02:41:48.680
you know, but it wasn't spiritual

6062
02:41:48.680 --> 02:41:49.160
so much

6063
02:41:49.160 --> 02:41:51.540
as he was looking for these answers

6064
02:41:51.540 --> 02:41:51.940
to meaning.

6065
02:41:52.060 --> 02:41:53.000
You know, why am I alive?

6066
02:41:53.000 --> 02:41:54.120
What does it mean for me to

6067
02:41:54.120 --> 02:41:54.600
be alive?

6068
02:41:54.680 --> 02:41:56.040
For what would I be willing to die?

6069
02:41:56.400 --> 02:41:57.280
And at the end of that,

6070
02:41:57.820 --> 02:41:59.240
this was kind of vaguely part of

6071
02:41:59.240 --> 02:41:59.820
the business plan,

6072
02:41:59.920 --> 02:42:01.380
but it became clear as time went on.

6073
02:42:01.420 --> 02:42:03.500
He said, I want to join the Marines.

6074
02:42:03.760 --> 02:42:05.980
I want to see what I'm made of.

6075
02:42:07.080 --> 02:42:08.260
And so he did and it was hard.

6076
02:42:08.500 --> 02:42:09.360
You know, bootcamp was hard.

6077
02:42:09.480 --> 02:42:11.180
He broke his foot a couple of times.

6078
02:42:11.500 --> 02:42:12.380
A couple of times?

6079
02:42:12.440 --> 02:42:12.740
Twice.

6080
02:42:12.880 --> 02:42:13.180
Jesus.

6081
02:42:13.340 --> 02:42:13.620
Yeah.

6082
02:42:13.680 --> 02:42:14.880
And then he went into the infantry

6083
02:42:14.880 --> 02:42:15.760
training battalion

6084
02:42:15.760 --> 02:42:16.780
because he was a war fighter,

6085
02:42:17.060 --> 02:42:18.220
which is 15% of the Marine

6086
02:42:18.220 --> 02:42:20.540
Corps are combat Marines.

6087
02:42:20.740 --> 02:42:20.900
What does that mean?

6088
02:42:21.060 --> 02:42:22.260
I thought they were all war fighters.

6089
02:42:22.260 --> 02:42:24.020
Yeah, but 85% are in support roles.

6090
02:42:24.140 --> 02:42:25.320
15% of the war fighters,

6091
02:42:25.600 --> 02:42:27.760
the door kickers and the riflemen.

6092
02:42:27.840 --> 02:42:29.200
Wow, I didn't realize it was that lopsided.

6093
02:42:29.200 --> 02:42:30.240
Yes, he was in the infantry.

6094
02:42:30.560 --> 02:42:31.260
Yeah, for sure.

6095
02:42:31.380 --> 02:42:33.220
I mean, there's logistics and mechanics.

6096
02:42:33.520 --> 02:42:34.620
And I mean, there's so many jobs

6097
02:42:34.620 --> 02:42:35.900
to support the 15%.

6098
02:42:35.900 --> 02:42:38.120
And then from there, he became a mortarman.

6099
02:42:38.160 --> 02:42:39.220
And from there, he went into the

6100
02:42:39.220 --> 02:42:40.540
elite sniper corps,

6101
02:42:40.640 --> 02:42:42.200
which is a really, really hard-

6102
02:42:42.200 --> 02:42:43.280
Were you freaked out during any of this?

6103
02:42:44.400 --> 02:42:45.580
Kind of, except that,

6104
02:42:46.520 --> 02:42:47.840
what do you want as a dad?

6105
02:42:48.360 --> 02:42:50.100
You want a kid who has the

6106
02:42:50.100 --> 02:42:51.760
answers to these questions.

6107
02:42:51.760 --> 02:42:52.940
Because this is what it means to

6108
02:42:52.940 --> 02:42:53.740
be fully alive.

6109
02:42:54.140 --> 02:42:56.300
This is a saint in the fourth

6110
02:42:56.300 --> 02:42:57.920
century named Saint Irenaeus.

6111
02:42:58.180 --> 02:42:59.460
And he's most famous for saying,

6112
02:42:59.620 --> 02:43:01.100
the glory of God is a man

6113
02:43:01.100 --> 02:43:02.000
fully alive.

6114
02:43:03.080 --> 02:43:04.460
Like, don't give me half dead.

6115
02:43:05.240 --> 02:43:06.500
Don't give me half dead.

6116
02:43:06.900 --> 02:43:07.940
And half dead is I don't know

6117
02:43:07.940 --> 02:43:08.600
why I'm alive

6118
02:43:08.600 --> 02:43:09.540
and I don't know what for what

6119
02:43:09.540 --> 02:43:10.300
I'm willing to die.

6120
02:43:10.460 --> 02:43:12.900
I want my kids, I want the

6121
02:43:12.900 --> 02:43:13.560
people in my life

6122
02:43:13.560 --> 02:43:14.880
and my friends to be able to

6123
02:43:14.880 --> 02:43:15.580
have answers

6124
02:43:15.580 --> 02:43:16.740
to these particular questions.

6125
02:43:16.800 --> 02:43:19.620
So, I was scared, but I was energized

6126
02:43:19.620 --> 02:43:21.240
by his particular energy.

6127
02:43:21.240 --> 02:43:23.040
And it's so interesting because the

6128
02:43:23.040 --> 02:43:24.300
sniper corps,

6129
02:43:24.420 --> 02:43:25.820
the Scout Sniper Platoon,

6130
02:43:26.140 --> 02:43:29.400
which is a branch of the special forces,

6131
02:43:30.240 --> 02:43:32.940
they sit three hours behind the scope

6132
02:43:32.940 --> 02:43:33.460
of a rifle,

6133
02:43:33.800 --> 02:43:34.540
just sitting there.

6134
02:43:34.740 --> 02:43:36.520
And this is a kid who couldn't

6135
02:43:36.520 --> 02:43:37.460
concentrate in school.

6136
02:43:38.040 --> 02:43:41.740
I mean, he's like ADHD, whatever that is.

6137
02:43:43.400 --> 02:43:45.260
It's a funny diagnosis.

6138
02:43:46.300 --> 02:43:50.720
Their motto is suffer patiently, patiently suffer.

6139
02:43:52.580 --> 02:43:53.700
Ha, that's my son.

6140
02:43:54.620 --> 02:43:55.940
I'm super proud of him.

6141
02:43:56.260 --> 02:43:58.440
I'm scared, but I'm super proud of him.

6142
02:43:58.540 --> 02:43:59.360
Is he active duty?

6143
02:43:59.700 --> 02:44:01.740
Yeah, he's active duty down at Camp

6144
02:44:01.740 --> 02:44:03.340
Pendleton right now.

6145
02:44:03.460 --> 02:44:04.000
Yeah, for sure.

6146
02:44:04.460 --> 02:44:04.860
For sure.

6147
02:44:05.220 --> 02:44:07.180
He's 23 years old, he's married.

6148
02:44:07.540 --> 02:44:07.940
Wow.

6149
02:44:08.200 --> 02:44:10.900
He's, he, cause when he, when he

6150
02:44:10.900 --> 02:44:11.660
got that,

6151
02:44:12.160 --> 02:44:13.280
you know, when he got that,

6152
02:44:13.340 --> 02:44:15.980
then things became clear when he answered.

6153
02:44:16.060 --> 02:44:16.940
Cause you know, why are you alive?

6154
02:44:17.080 --> 02:44:18.520
Did you already say what he said?

6155
02:44:18.600 --> 02:44:19.600
Cause if he did, sorry, I missed it.

6156
02:44:19.620 --> 02:44:20.200
No, I didn't.

6157
02:44:20.760 --> 02:44:24.600
His answers are, I am alive cause

6158
02:44:24.600 --> 02:44:25.360
God made me.

6159
02:44:26.100 --> 02:44:27.280
For what am I willing to die today?

6160
02:44:27.500 --> 02:44:29.920
For my faith, for my family, for

6161
02:44:29.920 --> 02:44:30.440
my friends,

6162
02:44:30.600 --> 02:44:31.660
and for the United States of America.

6163
02:44:31.920 --> 02:44:34.100
And for our allies, for those of

6164
02:44:34.100 --> 02:44:34.940
you listening or, you know,

6165
02:44:35.340 --> 02:44:36.360
that he'd die for you too.

6166
02:44:37.360 --> 02:44:39.160
And those aren't everybody's answers.

6167
02:44:39.320 --> 02:44:40.520
Those might not be your answers,

6168
02:44:40.640 --> 02:44:42.140
but man, those are solid answers.

6169
02:44:42.560 --> 02:44:45.020
And when you have the answers, life proceeds.

6170
02:44:45.880 --> 02:44:47.800
Life proceeds, life becomes linear.

6171
02:44:48.360 --> 02:44:49.440
Life becomes clear.

6172
02:44:50.200 --> 02:44:52.080
That's why meaning is so critically important.

6173
02:44:52.220 --> 02:44:53.900
And boy, my son taught me a lot.

6174
02:44:54.800 --> 02:44:55.880
He's like, I got the theories.

6175
02:44:56.040 --> 02:44:56.780
I got the data.

6176
02:44:57.420 --> 02:45:00.800
But seeing it play out, it's thrilling.

6177
02:45:01.860 --> 02:45:04.100
So, you know, the phone rings at

6178
02:45:04.100 --> 02:45:04.660
2 a.m.

6179
02:45:05.460 --> 02:45:06.320
Don't like it.

6180
02:45:06.800 --> 02:45:07.740
Not looking forward to that.

6181
02:45:08.400 --> 02:45:11.240
When he's like, yeah, going on a

6182
02:45:11.240 --> 02:45:11.780
field trip.

6183
02:45:13.140 --> 02:45:15.900
Not great, not great, but I'll take it.

6184
02:45:16.100 --> 02:45:16.880
I'll take it all day.

6185
02:45:19.640 --> 02:45:20.980
Every time I get to spend time

6186
02:45:20.980 --> 02:45:21.200
with you,

6187
02:45:21.340 --> 02:45:22.700
I love it the most.

6188
02:45:22.940 --> 02:45:23.380
It's amazing.

6189
02:45:23.480 --> 02:45:24.320
Where can people follow you?

6190
02:45:24.360 --> 02:45:25.380
Where can they get the new book?

6191
02:45:25.660 --> 02:45:25.980
Thank you.

September 12th from Penguin Random House.

6205
02:45:50.260 --> 02:45:53.080
I wrote it because I want people

6206
02:45:53.080 --> 02:45:55.560
to understand these ideas,

6207
02:45:55.760 --> 02:45:58.120
to change their habits and share these

6208
02:45:58.120 --> 02:45:58.860
ideas with others.

6209
02:45:59.500 --> 02:46:00.740
Thank you for having this conversation

Ah, thank you.
