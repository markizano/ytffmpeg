# BlockFi Bankruptcy Summary

## Introduction
In this post, I attempt to break down and answer some questions I have been seeing
on this subreddit that I think I can answer at best or lead to answers for most
or at least show where to find resources to learn more at worst.

Disclaimers:
- I'm just an IT guy on the internet trying to make sense of all this. I am no laywer.
  None of this is legal advice. Please seek legal council for what is best for you.
- Everything I am about to cover is my interpretation and perception of what I
  read or know about the situtation. As such, I may have missed some details or
  may be out of date on some things. With these errors in mind, I would appreciate
  help from community members that may be better in-the-know to comment with
  corrections.

I also pledge to you to remain as unbiased in my delivery of information as much
as possible, albeit I cannot remove all personality from my writing entirely.
My objective is to provide you with information here so you can make the right
decision for yourself. I know many people post things where that decision has
already been made for you and they are making an argument backing why you should
go in that direction. I want to be as intent on just providing information for
you to continue to have self-agency to make that decision for yourself.
I will also do my best to annotate when something pertains to my personal opinion
or interpretation of things.

This is a good-faith attempt to provide some answers to questions based on the
details I was able to obtain based on what I have seen so far. As much as I wish
I could have reviewed all of the court hearings, I was only able to attend the
very first two back in March when this was kicking off.

My name is Markizano, and I was caught up in all of this as well. I have a small
stash stuck in BIA currently and some interest from that spilled over into my
wallet. I will also disclaim that I was one of the elected who could request a
withdraw. I will cover more on this later, but wanted to disclaim those things
upfront.

## Index/Table of Contents
OK, with that out of the way, I wish to present to you my findings of informations
with an attempt to make it easier to find and index your way to gather the decision
you need to make for yourself and what's best for you.

# Timeline of Events

If you don't know, I hope you're now aware that BlockFi has filed for Chapter 11
bankruptcy. [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chapter_11,_Title_11,_United_States_Code)

Quick note: Chapter 11 (restructuring) differs from Chapter 7 (liquidation) in
that a Ch.11 means there's a chance the company can go on if we can all agree
everyone is paid as best we can pay them. It may result in a Ch.7, which means
complete liquidation (selling) of all assets and the company is dissolved (out of
business).

Personal note: When I saw BlockFi attempting a Chapter 11 instead of just admitting
to a Chapter 7, I had hope the company could survive this and possibly learn a
lot of lessons from this. Reason for this was how they conducted themselves in
the courtroom. They did the Honorable Kaplan the honour of actually educating
him a bit in Bitcoin, crypto and how all of it works before going into the
proceeding. They conducted themselves well and presented a plan to go forward as
best they could come up with on the spot and I had not yet read the contents of
The Plan since it was still being drafted at the time. There was first order of
business of getting into the case and updating the UI to reflect things for those
who were not in the courtroom with them figuring out how to go forward.

  about their bank, Silvergate, would be honouring the holiday and would be closed.
  So, a warning to investors that withdrawals would not be procesed until NOV14.
  Yes [the very same one that collapsed](https://is.gd/WW10qk) not too long after this tweet 

- 2022-11-10: That night, nearly 12 hours later, BlockFi ends the day with a
  [chilling message](https://twitter.com/BlockFi/status/1590875997351866368) about
  the uncertainty as to whether they can continue conducting business. This was
  the pivotal tweet in the court case that will later determine the cutoff time
  we were supposed to know that we needed our money out and away from BlockFi
  before they froze operations.
