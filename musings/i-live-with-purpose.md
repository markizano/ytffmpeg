I live with intention and purpose.
I exist by the moment.
For the now is the most important.
I am a seeker of truth, I transcend lives.
I allow people into my life, not the other way around.
I didn't give you permission to piss me off.
For I am existance incarnate.
I am the living body of consciousness.
My choices are mine to take.
I am the evolving ether that exists between the space of the concrete of this plane.
