1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.420
Okay, so here's a diatribe of my

2
00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:02.920
own to share:

3
00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:05.200
So many people around me do stupid

4
00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:06.160
stuff to get attention.

5
00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:09.140
What is attention but the idea that

6
00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:10.300
someone is looking at you?

7
00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:13.020
And what kind of attention do you want?

8
00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:15.440
Do you want the loving kind that

9
00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:16.680
kisses you on the forehead at night.

10
00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:17.960
A strong hug to

11
00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:19.940
remind you that you are loved. A

12
00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:22.060
kindred look of adoration and admiration?

13
00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:24.380
Or do you want the kind of

14
00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:26.080
attention where one is angry with

15
00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:27.180
you because that's the only

16
00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.280
kind of attention that you get. The

17
00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:30.980
kind that zaps energy from others,

18
00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:31.980
especially if you

19
00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.320
love them. The kind of attention where

20
00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.980
one looks at you with contempt and disdain?

21
00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:39.700
All that matters is energy.

22
00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:42.120
Do you want energy of abundance or

23
00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.540
energy of scarcity?

24
00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:46.600
It also boils down to how much

25
00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.960
energy and what kind of energy do

26
00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.020
you feed yourself?

27
00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.860
What do you feed yourself with?

28
00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:55.200
When my co-workers don't pay attention

29
00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.040
to me, a younger me would fumble

30
00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:57.520
around with

31
00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:58.960
things like: "They don't care about

32
00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:00.600
me!" ...and... "I'm going to get laid

33
00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:01.540
off from work if I don't

34
00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:03.920
work!" ...and... "I'm not worth anything if

35
00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:05.060
I'm not doing something!"

36
00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.800
The present me now says, if they

37
00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:09.420
don't pay the same attention I give,

38
00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:10.580
then I simply won't

39
00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:11.840
pay them as much attention.

40
00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:13.720
It's an equal exchange, you see.

41
00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.120
By paying me attention, it's like

42
00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:17.640
they are showing appreciation for

43
00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.100
my time, my efforts,

44
00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:20.500
and my attention.

45
00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.180
Besides, I have plenty to pay my

46
00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:25.280
attention towards that serves me in

47
00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:26.400
place of those I'm

48
00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.580
appealing for attention.

49
00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.260
It also comes from a place of,

50
00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:32.680
"I am sufficient, I am enough."

51
00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:35.160
When my friends don't pay me attention,

52
00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:36.680
I simply go about my day as

53
00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:37.580
if they never existed.

54
00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:40.120
In reality, in that moment, they don't.

55
00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.340
In that moment, I have my desires,

56
00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:44.860
my goals, my accomplishments to achieve

57
00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:45.460
that one day

58
00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:48.340
someone may write about them in my obituary.

59
00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:49.920
And when my friends do pay me

60
00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.340
attention, I return the favor.

61
00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:54.560
I am present because they matter.

62
00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:57.320
When you reach that place of believing

63
00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:00.240
in yourself enough to love yourself, suddenly

64
00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.180
the world changes.

65
00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.440
Suddenly you are no longer the victim

66
00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:05.480
of a lack of attention from others.

67
00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:08.080
When you become your own source of

68
00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:10.020
power, your own battery, and your

69
00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.300
own plug, you notice

70
00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:12.860
that people act differently around you.

71
00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.000
You no longer have time for flakes

72
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.620
and fakes.

73
00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.440
They seem to find another place to

74
00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.960
leech upon.

75
00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:21.700
When you are sufficient, suddenly

76
00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.320
you think from an abundance mindset

77
00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:26.160
rather than a scarce

78
00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.460
one.

79
00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.280
Patience is an interesting one as well.

80
00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.140
Patience is simply doing something

81
00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:34.280
else while you wait for whatever it

82
00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:35.400
is you want to be

83
00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:36.640
complete or available.

84
00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.140
Patience goes a long way.

85
00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:41.760
A pause can go a long way.

86
00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:45.280
Allow time to pass such that the

87
00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:46.820
universe can work its magic.

88
00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:49.800
Because time is magical.

89
00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.040
Time is precious.

90
00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:54.780
How much of your time will be

91
00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:57.540
spent in a scarce mindset and how

92
00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:59.060
much of it will you live in

93
00:02:59.060 --> 00:02:59.420
abundance?

94
00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:02.400
There are two things in life that

95
00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:03.460
are stolen the most:

96
00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:06.460
That is your time and attention.

97
00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.100
Choose wisely how you decide you will

98
00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.680
spend them.
