1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.660
Alright, I thought this was funny,

2
00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:02.360
had to share!

3
00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:04.760
But to give a fuck is not

4
00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:06.000
the same as having a fuck.

5
00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:07.680
But to fuck is follar.

6
00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:09.500
But if you fuck, then you joder.

7
00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:11.700
Pero si tu jodas, then you're fucking

8
00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:12.060
with me.

9
00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.900
Si estas follandome, then it's a good time.

10
00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:16.540
Pero no me jodas is not to

11
00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:17.020
fuck with me.

12
00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:19.340
Pero no me follas means no.

13
00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.480
Pasando el rato follando is a good afternoon.

14
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.500
But if you're haciendo joder, then

15
00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:25.620
you gotta be kidding me.

16
00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:28.420
Joder macho is like fucking man, but

17
00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:29.960
it still doesn't translate right...

18
00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.780
Cojer can be to choose or to fuck.

19
00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:34.960
Pero cojer a cojer is to choose

20
00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:35.540
to fuck, right?

21
00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:38.300
But no, that would be elegir a

22
00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:38.940
follar, si/no?

23
00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:41.580
Fuck can be used in all eight

24
00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:43.380
forms of speech in English.

25
00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:45.320
Is it the same in other languages?

26
00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:47.420
What is that one word of your

27
00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:50.180
language that has all parts of speech available?
