# YABA: Yet Another Budgeting App

This scene is the opening scene to introduce the idea of what is going on -- Yaba: Yet Another Budgeting
App. We get to see it come to fruition, but it has its parts in which its still very clearly under
development. This first scene kicks things off with a conversation between the CEO and the Business
Analyst. They meet for their weekly meeting and we get some insights into how the app starts off
as an idea in the CEO's mind.


Camera: zoompan from window to full frame containing subject seated in chair at desk, looking to the
side in a pondering state.

CEO: *ponders to himself, rattling on the desk...*

Camera: Fade transition to my YouTube video talking about budgeting.
Camera: Quick zoom out from head to full frame.

CEO (inner narrative): I should start using an app for this.

Camera: Pan to searches about YNAB, Quicken, Mint.

CEO (inner narrative): No, none of these work the way I need them to...

*BizAnalyst walks in*

BizAnalyst: Hey boss, how's it going?

CEO: Hey, doing great! I've got an idea for an app here.

BizAnalyst: Well, I'm doing great, thanks. What kind of app are you thinking?

CEO: I need a way to track my budgeting, but I don't like the way the other apps do it. They all
seem to clunky treating transactions like bars you drop in a bucket rather than sticky notes I can attach
to each transaction. Do you think we could put something together?

BizAnalyst: Sure, I can have a chat with the devs to throw something together. Can you add a little
more color to the layout you're looking for?

CEO: I'm looking for something that will give a place where I can tag all my transactions if I need
to a certain way. We can use that to train an AI bot to attempt to match my tagging patterns and I
can just audit them. I think this would be great
