Understanding the fundamentals of programming.

3 main Types of languages:
- Procedural/Scripting
- Object-oriented
- Functional

Programming is algebraic english!

Things to consider when starting a new project when it comes to programming languages:
- Language support: is this a dead/dying language nobody knows like Fortran? Is it wildly
    incompatible with itself like Python?
- developer community: is the community of a higher social class or treat the language like a
    religion like C/C++?
- libraries available: is there a bunch of code already written that does most of what you want
    to do? will you have to write a lot yourself?

Let's get into it!

# Variables
When programming, most of what you'll be doing is storing data of sorts. Variables are used to store
these values when working with them. Variables, at their core, are just the binary 1's and 0's you
think you see computers processing stuff. However, those 0's and 1's can combine to represent a
universe of information.

## Native Primary Data Types
Let's cover the primary data types:
- Boolean
- Number
-- Float
-- Long
-- Short

### Boolean
A boolean is the truest of a binary: It can be true or false. That's it. 0 usually represents false.
1 usually represents true if coerced into numbers. Booleans are useful because they are the fundamental
unit of conditions.

### Number: Int/Long/Short
Numbers come in a few flavors based on the size, sign (+/-) and where/whether there is a decimal.
Integer and Long are two familiar data types that represent whole numbers. There is no decimal place
to represent fractions since the decimal place is fixed at 0. However, this permits you to create
numbers as large as 2^64 and store them in a single variable as a Long itself.

### Number: Float
Numbers that could be fractions or include decimal places are called a "Float" for the "floating decimal
point". 

Let's cover the more complex data types:
- String
- Array
- Object

# Operators
In programming, yes, math is involved, but it's very minimal and basic. Most of the mathematical
operations in writing code is mostly associated with the sciences like Physics. Basic operators
are used to combine and assign values to variables that contain data.
