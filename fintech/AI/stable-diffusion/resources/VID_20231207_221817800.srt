1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.520
I'm going to show you what real-time

2
00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:02.840
image generation looks like

3
00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:04.200
with Stable Diffusion Turbo.

4
00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:09.080
Attack on Titan, a 4K soldier.

5
00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:10.380
Me: (I probably should just stitch it,

6
00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.940
but oh well.)

7
00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:16.180
Beautiful landscape scenery with vast

8
00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:22.120
buildings sprawled out across the image.

9
00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:27.820
Night standing on a cliff overlooking

10
00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:28.860
the town.

11
00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:30.660
 

12
00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:31.320
 

13
00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:34.440
 

14
00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.120
 

15
00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.940
 

16
00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:41.940
 

17
00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:44.400
So, I pretty much copied that prompt.

18
00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.460
I managed to find the Turbo SDXL

19
00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:51.560
version of the safe tensors.

20
00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:53.680
Managed to copy the prompt.

21
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.560
I don't exactly know what he does

22
00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:57.920
for all of his parameters, but hey,

23
00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:59.100
I got it working.

24
00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:00.600
And, uh.

25
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.380
See all of the different generations

26
00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:04.420
that are possible with this prompt.

27
00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:05.820
And it's just going to keep generating.

28
00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:07.500
And now this was all done with

29
00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.080
Comfy UI on GitHub using the latest

30
00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.720
and greatest Stable Diffusion Turbo

31
00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:13.600
that was released by Stability AI.

32
00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.760
So, that's exactly what that is.

33
00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.640
I mean, I don't exactly know what

34
00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:21.780
I'm doing with all of this as

35
00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.560
I dip into it and try to

36
00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:24.180
figure it out.

37
00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:25.860
But, I know I need to learn it.

38
00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.140
And, this is, like, really cool.

39
00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:31.620
I mean, you just download and go.

40
00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:37.120
And, I mean, they give you such

41
00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:39.120
incredible options that you can use

42
00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:41.440
to, like, truly control and fine-tune

43
00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:44.220
how you want any and everything to

44
00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.060
show up in the results.

45
00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:51.820
Oh yeah, and I haven't quite yet

46
00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:53.680
figured out how he got it to

47
00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:54.480
auto-generate.

48
00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:56.600
I changed the seed.

49
00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:58.320
This isn't moving as fast.

50
00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:01.120
But, it did generate an image.

51
00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:02.620
Man, that's kewl!

52
00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:03.980
That's kewl, man!
