1
00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:02.280
Okay, so this is kind of cool.

2
00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:04.140
I'm dipping my toes into AI again.

3
00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:05.500
I managed to download

4
00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:08.320
Stable Diffusion. (Excuse me for the

5
00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:09.980
coughs, I'm kind of sick.) But I

6
00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:10.640
downloaded Stable

7
00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:12.900
Diffusion and you can find it on

8
00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.280
the githubs at Automatic1111/stable-diffusion-webui

9
00:00:16.281 --> 00:00:16.282
 

10
00:00:16.362 --> 00:00:19.400
They created an interface that

11
00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:21.320
we can use. You can just run

12
00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:22.540
the entry point, configure

13
00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:24.680
it to your desires, and boom, you

14
00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:26.920
have yourself an agent running. I'm

15
00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:27.840
actually using my gaming

16
00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.480
box for this. I probably should stop

17
00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:31.040
making gaming boxes because I end

18
00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:32.100
up just,

19
00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:34.300
turning them into other things. But

20
00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:35.400
once you get that set up and

21
00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:36.220
running and going, it'll

22
00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:37.580
go ahead and get you set up

23
00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:39.600
with this lovely interface where you

24
00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.680
can pretty much type in

25
00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:43.280
what it is you want. So we

26
00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:48.280
can say something like a green forest

27
00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:55.400
scene. A green forest

28
00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:58.960
with an archer overlooking a city

29
00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:02.800
with an elf tower in the background

30
00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:05.180
of Middle Earth.

31
00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.880
Ctrl+Enter to hit generate. And

32
00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.160
that will go ahead and start generating

33
00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:11.460
an image. Now

34
00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.320
because my gaming system has more

35
00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.480
GPU RAM or VRAM, whatever you want

36
00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:17.660
to call it, for

37
00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:20.640
that system, then what ends up happening

38
00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.460
is this actually generates a lot faster than

39
00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:24.440
my laptop. If you notice that, that

40
00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:27.740
was in like mere seconds. You know,

41
00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:28.380
it just creates

42
00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.700
these lovely rich images after tinkering

43
00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.060
around with it a little bit and

44
00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.480
getting my

45
00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:34.840
prompts right. I can show you how

46
00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:35.740
to set up these things so you

47
00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:36.600
can have your own internal

48
00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.300
network so that I can, you know,

49
00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:39.600
use my `/etc/hosts` and point it

50
00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.760
over to another machine

51
00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:43.560
within my local network. And then

52
00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.840
stable diffusion just runs as a daemon

53
00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:46.380
that starts

54
00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.100
up a web interface and you can

55
00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.120
download different models that allow

56
00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:53.440
you to generate things

57
00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:55.000
based on different stuff. So like

58
00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.160
I can switch this over to like

59
00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:58.740
a YamerAnime_UltraInfinity_V5+VAE

60
00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.280
model that they created. It might

61
00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:02.640
take a second for it to load

62
00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.280
that into memory. And then

63
00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:05.960
we can generate an image based on

64
00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:07.840
the other model. I'll go ahead and

65
00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:08.500
skip along so you

66
00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:10.460
guys can see the finished result.

67
00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:12.800
Alright, so once that's done and loaded

68
00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:13.260
into memory,

69
00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:14.860
you can use that to generate your

70
00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:16.840
image and it will produce something

71
00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:17.720
for you right now.

72
00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:20.280
Actually, that's a lot faster so we

73
00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:21.500
don't have to worry about it. But

74
00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.880
yeah, you can

75
00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:23.520
see how other models have maybe like

76
00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:26.140
different artistic feels to how they

77
00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.660
want to generate

78
00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:27.900
some stuff. I thought this was really

79
00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:28.980
cool. I just wanted to share this

80
00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:30.700
and possibly could

81
00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:32.840
do some videos on how I got

82
00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:34.200
this set up as I learned about

83
00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.000
it. I'd rather be a little

84
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.020
bit more versed in it. I don't

85
00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.900
like talking about things I don't

86
00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:39.660
know, but this was just

87
00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:40.860
really cool. I had to share. It

88
00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:42.800
was fun, man. It was fun, man.

89
00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:43.120
It was kewl! 8)
