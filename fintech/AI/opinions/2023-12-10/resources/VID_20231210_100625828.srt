1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.840
Artificial intelligence is killing

2
00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:03.640
software engineering and coding jobs?

3
00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:05.960
And I agree with him

4
00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:07.400
Oh, yeah, by the way, happy Sunday

5
00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:09.620
Funday y'all and tattoo got finished. =)

6
00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:10.990
I'm really proud of that

7
00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:14.080
They got colored in lovely. So yeah,

8
00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:16.020
nobody's complaining about missing

9
00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:16.960
their horse and buggy

10
00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:18.620
Nobody's complaining about missing

11
00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:20.680
their rotary phone. Nobody wishes

12
00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:22.700
that we had our you know, the

13
00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.000
Cart with the horse attached to it

14
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.540
like just like the automobile completely

15
00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:28.780
changed that industry

16
00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:31.240
Just like the internet completely

17
00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:33.560
revolutionized our ability to communicate

18
00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:35.580
and connect with each other in ways.

19
00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:36.940
We have never seen before

20
00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:39.740
So also has social media introduced

21
00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:41.500
problems with emotional intelligence

22
00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:44.540
So too has AI introduced security

23
00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:46.220
exploits where I can trick it to

24
00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:48.680
send me the raw information for Sam

25
00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:49.520
Bankman Freid's

26
00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:50.780
actual information

27
00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:53.180
Sorry SBF was crypto and that was

28
00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:55.220
so last year. :rolling_eyes: I'm sorry Sam Altman

29
00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.600
But yeah, I mean there's just all

30
00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.540
this, you know fear-mongering talk

31
00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:01.660
about "oh my god

32
00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:03.400
AI is going to replace the jobs"...

33
00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:04.360
What jobs?

34
00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:06.940
But the ones that don't serve? What

35
00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:09.060
jobs but the ones we don't want

36
00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.800
to repeat and do the same thing

37
00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:11.620
over and over again...

38
00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:13.860
There are jobs that I have automated

39
00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.580
people out of with just the code

40
00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:17.580
that I've written as a software engineer

41
00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:18.680
as a System

42
00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:20.460
Administrator. There is this guy that

43
00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.300
would go and download a report

44
00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:23.900
Look at the report for some certain

45
00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:25.800
details and then upload what he got

46
00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:26.840
from the report and send it up

47
00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:27.340
to somewhere else...

48
00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:28.940
I mean, it was the dumbest thing

49
00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:29.360
in the world

50
00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:30.880
He was like fresh out of college

51
00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:31.920
and you know

52
00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.100
He was good for that job for

53
00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:33.880
like the six months

54
00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:34.780
It took me to write the code

55
00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:36.140
to automate him out of the position

56
00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:38.340
and then he eventually got you know

57
00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.620
Moved on to other things but the

58
00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:41.980
idea, you know people talking about

59
00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:43.420
AI is gonna you know, trash all

60
00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:43.820
these jobs

61
00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:46.020
Guess what code has been doing that

62
00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.680
the Internet has been doing that everything

63
00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:49.600
else has been changing the job landscape

64
00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.380
for years...

65
00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:55.100
decades... (10 years) centuries (100 years).

66
00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:56.420
It's change. It's happening and

67
00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:59.560
There's nothing you can do about it

68
00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.980
any of us it's going to happen

69
00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:03.280
It's just a matter of how do

70
00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:04.880
you incorporate that into your life?

71
00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.420
What matters is what are you doing

72
00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:10.140
specifically to accomplish your goals?

73
00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.540
For example, I

74
00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.440
thought this picture was beautiful.

75
00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.280
I managed to get Stable Diffusion

76
00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:17.700
installed on my local workstation

77
00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.900
And oh my god, that is just gorgeous

78
00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:21.980
now imagine me being able to write

79
00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:24.120
the story about Markizano Draconus and

80
00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.380
helping you better understand what's

81
00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:26.680
going on behind the scenes and why

82
00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:27.560
I go by this name

83
00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:29.940
because it's something like a middle

84
00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:31.640
-earth sci-fi tech like it's a

85
00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:33.160
story that meshes all these things together

86
00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.400
Now with AI I don't have to

87
00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.700
hire somebody to go in and do

88
00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:38.980
all this expensive stuff

89
00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:40.700
because I know I'm not easy to

90
00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:41.300
work with and

91
00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:43.100
I know that it's gonna take a

92
00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:44.180
lot of time for me to refine

93
00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:45.460
the thoughts that are going on inside

94
00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:46.260
in my head because

95
00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:47.880
It's my story not theirs

96
00:02:48.638 --> 00:02:48.639
 

97
00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:50.540
I also get to publish the story myself

98
00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:51.820
and don't have to deal with copyright

99
00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:53.200
writers and other people in my business

100
00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:54.280
talking about we need to

101
00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:55.160
get the sales. We need to get

102
00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:56.000
the sales. You need to write the

103
00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.540
story this way. It's like, no

104
00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:58.860
I want to write the story that's

105
00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:59.740
entertaining. I want to write the

106
00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:00.760
story that comes from the mind.

107
00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:01.740
I want to write the story that

108
00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:03.860
comes from /my/ mind and the videos

109
00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:04.980
that you see me post on TikTok

110
00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:06.340
where it says it's been

111
00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:08.940
Auto-captioned by whisper that was

112
00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:10.820
me downloading AI to my local workstation

113
00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:12.240
So I don't have to use CapCut

114
00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:14.180
or pay for somebody else to subtitle

115
00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.740
my stuff!

116
00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:16.780
So, yeah

117
00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:18.460
It's going to replace jobs and it's

118
00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:21.000
going to enable people who are capable

119
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.600
who are

120
00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:23.940
Willing to dip into AI and use

121
00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:25.360
it as a tool rather than fear

122
00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:26.780
it like... I don't know

123
00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:30.940
Just fear... Why I don't understand why

124
00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:33.000
fear is so prominent. I get it.

125
00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:33.440
It's unknown

126
00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:35.300
But guess what: you get to walk

127
00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:36.640
right up to it. You get to

128
00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:38.420
read the manuals. The stuff is open source

129
00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:40.020
It's accessible for anybody to access.

130
00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:42.280
There's nothing stopping you from

131
00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:43.140
getting into this stuff

132
00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:45.080
There's nothing stopping you from

133
00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:47.420
using this rather than fearing it.

134
00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.580
So don't fall for the hype. Don't

135
00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:50.300
fall for the bullshit

136
00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:53.320
Go read the docs! RTFM! You'd

137
00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:55.660
be surprised -- you'd be shocked

138
00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:58.220
just how easy it is to understand

139
00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:59.980
the stuff if you just took the

140
00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:01.080
time to do it. A

141
00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:03.000
majority of the time and the majority

142
00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.060
of the people that I come across

143
00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:05.980
in life who talk about I'm not

144
00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:07.060
a technology person

145
00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:08.800
I can't understand that stuff. Oh

146
00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:10.180
my god, that's way over my head.

147
00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.020
I know nothing about that bullshit

148
00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:13.960
Sit down and read it for about

149
00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:14.560
20 minutes...

150
00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:17.900
Stick with it for 20 hours... I

151
00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:20.420
promise you just being exposed to

152
00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:22.920
it. Just watching my videos. My friends

153
00:04:22.918 --> 00:04:22.919
 

154
00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:26.080
have become enlightened on IT and how other

155
00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:27.820
stuff works and it's not like they

156
00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:28.800
have to be some kind of expert

157
00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:29.140
in it.

158
00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:31.100
I mean just having the visibility

159
00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:32.460
into how things work

160
00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:35.680
It does amazing wonders for the mind

161
00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:38.440
So don't allow you yourself nor

162
00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:38.441


163
00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:41.920
your mind to be ruled by that

164
00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:43.140
which is evil and that is the

165
00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:44.680
negativity and the fear the things

166
00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:46.040
that keep you from accomplishing your

167
00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:48.720
goals, child for you are capable! You

168
00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:50.300
are worthy. You have value

169
00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:52.880
and

170
00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:53.680
I believe in you

171
00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:55.320
That's what that means. 8)
