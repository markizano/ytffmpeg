0:00:00.040 --> 0:00:02.060
Here is your Linux command of

2
0:00:02.060 --> 0:00:02.480
the day.

3
0:00:03.100 --> 0:00:03.980
`cmatrix`

4
0:00:05.040 --> 0:00:08.600
That's pretty cool, isn't it?

5
0:00:08.860 --> 0:00:09.680
Ha ha ha.

6
0:00:10.040 --> 0:00:11.180
Did you know you can pipe

7
0:00:11.180 --> 0:00:11.740
the output

8
0:00:11.740 --> 0:00:14.640
of any other command into lolcat?

9
0:00:14.640 --> 0:00:18.560
and you get this amazing glorified

10
0:00:18.560 --> 0:00:19.740
rainbow unicorn output?

11
0:00:21.020 --> 0:00:22.560
Isn't that just amazing?

12
0:00:22.960 --> 0:00:23.680
Ha ha ha.

13
0:00:24.120 --> 0:00:24.740
Hey, wait a minute....

14
0:00:26.060 --> 0:00:28.940
Wait a minute, wait a minute,

15
0:00:29.020 --> 0:00:29.300
wait a minute....

16
0:00:30.500 --> 0:00:32.400
 

17
0:00:32.400 --> 0:00:32.620
 

18
0:00:33.320 --> 0:00:36.700
It's Fruity Pebbles matrix.

19
0:00:38.600 --> 0:00:40.500
Hey, wait, there's this other command

20
0:00:40.500 --> 0:00:41.320
called fortune.

21
0:00:42.540 --> 0:00:44.920
It tells you your fortune.

22
0:00:46.380 --> 0:00:48.500
But there's this other command called

23
0:00:48.500 --> 0:00:49.440
cowsay.

24
0:00:50.960 --> 0:00:54.260
Where you can have a cow,

25
0:00:54.380 --> 0:00:56.040
pretty much prints ASCII text

26
0:00:56.040 --> 0:00:57.480
that says any word.

27
0:00:58.500 --> 0:00:59.060
Hey, wait a minute.

28
0:01:00.000 --> 0:01:00.180
Ha ha ha ha ha ha.

29
0:01:00.180 --> 0:01:04.580
Oh my.

30
0:01:05.420 --> 0:01:07.040
Ha ha ha ha ha ha.

31
0:01:07.740 --> 0:01:08.980
All right, here's for the finale.

32
0:01:09.680 --> 0:01:11.260
This one, this one's gonna blow

33
0:01:11.260 --> 0:01:11.920
your socks off.

34
0:01:13.520 --> 0:01:14.580
Wait, no, I need to get

35
0:01:14.580 --> 0:01:15.360
the audio set right.

36
0:01:17.740 --> 0:01:19.100
This is crazy.

37
0:01:19.500 --> 0:01:20.500
So here's my number.

38
0:01:20.920 --> 0:01:21.840
So call me maybe.

39
0:01:23.620 --> 0:01:26.020
Now that's, ha ha ha ha

40
0:01:26.020 --> 0:01:26.320
  

41
0:01:26.860 --> 0:01:29.341
Ah, that's absolutely crazy

42
0:01:29.460 --> 0:01:30.060
right there.
