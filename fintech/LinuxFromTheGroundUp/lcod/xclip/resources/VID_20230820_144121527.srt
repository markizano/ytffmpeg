0:00:00.820 --> 0:00:02.820
Here is your Linux command of

2
0:00:02.820 --> 0:00:06.500
the day: xclip. This gives you

3
0:00:06.500 --> 0:00:07.260
command-line access

4
0:00:07.260 --> 0:00:09.060
to your clipboard. It's really cool.

5
0:00:10.280 --> 0:00:12.460
Oh yeah, did you know Linux

6
0:00:12.460 --> 0:00:13.080
has multiple

7
0:00:13.080 --> 0:00:16.080
clipboards? I remember when Android

8
0:00:16.080 --> 0:00:17.460
had like 10 of them, or

9
0:00:17.460 --> 0:00:19.380
at least LG did. But

10
0:00:19.380 --> 0:00:21.620
yeah, there's primary, there's secondary,

11
0:00:21.880 --> 0:00:24.500
and there's clipboard. Oh yeah, did

12
0:00:24.500 --> 0:00:24.620
you

13
0:00:24.620 --> 0:00:25.960
know it supported multiple formats

14
0:00:25.960 --> 0:00:27.300
with the `-t` option too?

15
0:00:28.160 --> 0:00:29.140
So you mean to tell

16
0:00:29.140 --> 0:00:30.260
me I can take text on

17
0:00:30.260 --> 0:00:32.440
the screen and select it in

18
0:00:32.440 --> 0:00:33.800
the terminal to put it on

19
0:00:33.800 --> 0:00:36.880
the clipboard, and I can run

20
0:00:36.880 --> 0:00:37.980
a command that gives me the

21
0:00:37.980 --> 0:00:40.680
output, and I can just

22
0:00:40.680 --> 0:00:41.820
grep out the stuff that I

23
0:00:41.820 --> 0:00:43.800
want and slice and dice? Well

24
0:00:43.800 --> 0:00:44.740
gee, if you wonder why I

25
0:00:44.740 --> 0:00:46.100
find things faster than you, this

26
0:00:46.100 --> 0:00:48.920
might be it. Oh yeah, remember

27
0:00:48.920 --> 0:00:50.200
that QR encode

28
0:00:50.200 --> 0:00:52.480
video that we did before? Well,

29
0:00:52.800 --> 0:00:53.940
let me just take a screenshot

30
0:00:53.940 --> 0:00:54.420
of this.

31
0:01:00.080 --> 0:01:01.140
So if we try to take

32
0:01:01.140 --> 0:01:02.200
a look at the contents of

33
0:01:02.200 --> 0:01:05.020
the clipboard, we get gobbledygook.

34
0:01:05.560 --> 0:01:06.940
Well, I guess you're gonna have

35
0:01:06.940 --> 0:01:07.880
to take a screenshot of that

36
0:01:07.880 --> 0:01:08.760
QR code and tell me

37
0:01:08.760 --> 0:01:11.060
what you found. Because if I

38
0:01:11.060 --> 0:01:12.500
take the contents of the clipboard

39
0:01:12.500 --> 0:01:12.980
and put it

40
0:01:12.980 --> 0:01:14.720
inside of a file, and then

41
0:01:14.720 --> 0:01:15.520
we take a look at that

42
0:01:15.520 --> 0:01:23.020
file, we get that QR code

43
0:01:23.020 --> 0:01:23.300
back.

44
0:01:24.740 --> 0:01:26.680
Hmm, I wonder what it says.

45
0:01:27.560 --> 0:01:29.460
So yeah, it's fun accessing our

46
0:01:29.460 --> 0:01:30.800
clipboard from the command line!
