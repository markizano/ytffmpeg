1
00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:02.640
So, let's talk about server automation,

2
00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:03.800
SaltStack edition.

3
00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:06.100
Hey y'all, it's Markizano.

4
00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:07.420
In this video, we're going to talk

5
00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:09.280
about Minions and I can't believe

6
00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:10.120
it, but I'm actually building

7
00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:11.060
quite a library here.

8
00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:12.660
I also have six other videos to

9
00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.020
go check out if you're curious and

10
00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:15.120
want to learn more about

11
00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:15.640
SaltStack.

12
00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:19.820
So, the SaltMinions job is an agent

13
00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:21.860
that's running on your *server (excuse me),

14
00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:22.380
on your server.

15
00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.800
It can install the services that you

16
00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.720
need, like say you're creating a generic

17
00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:29.820
web application

18
00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.560
set up, which requires an Nginx server

19
00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:34.700
or Apache to be running, to forward

20
00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:35.180
the request

21
00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:38.180
down to some PHP, Python, Perl, some

22
00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:41.020
application (Java even)

23
00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:41.740
you are running

24
00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:43.920
that may be talking to some database,

25
00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:49.520
be it MySQL, MariaDB, some NoSQL solution

26
00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:50.120
like CouchDB

27
00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.900
or MongoDB, does not matter, SaltStack

28
00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:54.540
will be able to go and install

29
00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:55.760
it, configure it,

30
00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.400
service it, and execute against it.

31
00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:00.460
What's really cool about SaltStack

32
00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:02.800
is you can use configuration directives

33
00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:03.520
to describe

34
00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:05.580
specifically how you want your server

35
00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.460
to be set up and even with

36
00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:09.200
its custom execution pipeline,

37
00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.620
you can also execute custom commands

38
00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:14.040
to get information from your servers

39
00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:14.900
as well.

40
00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:16.380
This stuff is really cool.

41
00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:19.300
So here's a use case for the

42
00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:20.580
execution pipeline.

43
00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:23.020
Say you have a SaltMaster who's connected

44
00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:25.160
to a set of Minions and we

45
00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.760
want to find out

46
00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:27.460
what version of Nginx is actually

47
00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:28.880
installed on each of the machines.

48
00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:30.960
From the SaltMaster, you can issue

49
00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.100
a command to the Minions themselves.

50
00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:34.980
The Minions will go and execute the

51
00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:37.520
command, get the console output, return

52
00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:38.160
that back to

53
00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:39.940
the SaltMaster, and you get to see

54
00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:41.900
that from a central console point

55
00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:42.380
of view.

56
00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:44.760
This gives you a central commanding

57
00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:46.960
control center where you have full

58
00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:48.160
control over every

59
00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:51.160
specific aspect of your systems, and

60
00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:52.040
as long as you can get the

61
00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:53.360
developers out of the boxes,

62
00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.040
you will have full control over your

63
00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:56.720
entire setup.

64
00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.140
It's really awesome.

65
00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:02.260
Oh, what's also really cool is the

66
00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.540
Salt setup has its own CRON built in.

67
00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:07.500
So if you don't have CRON installed,

68
00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:09.520
which is really unusual in a Linux environment,

69
00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:12.220
probably more common in Windows-like

70
00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:14.340
environments where you need something

71
00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:15.580
to be executed at

72
00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:17.580
specific intervals or scheduled to

73
00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.680
execute at specific times.

74
00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.920
SaltStack has a built-in engine that

75
00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:25.140
is kept track with the clock so

76
00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:26.200
that you can execute

77
00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.820
things and schedule them at your own needs.

78
00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:32.760
Generally speaking, the Minions are

79
00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.380
present to ensure that there's a communication channel

80
00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:37.980
between the SaltMaster and the host

81
00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.440
itself upon which the Minion is running.

82
00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:42.820
And so what this allows you to

83
00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:45.440
do is it allows you to always

84
00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:47.280
have something available so

85
00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:48.980
that you can go and query information

86
00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:50.880
off of a specific environment without

87
00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:51.380
having to

88
00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:54.400
SSH into every single box, which can

89
00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:55.360
be very tedious.

90
00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:58.440
I really hope this series on SaltStack

91
00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:58.940
was helpful.

92
00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:02.220
I plan on doing something more formal,

93
00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:03.980
more proper on my YouTube channel

94
00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:04.960
because I don't

95
00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:06.340
like that I currently just take my

96
00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:07.820
TikTok videos and post them to YouTube.

97
00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:09.660
I want to create content that is

98
00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:11.580
specific for the other platform, that

99
00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:12.240
is destined for

100
00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:14.400
the other platform with, you know,

101
00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:16.900
the proper frame ratio.

102
00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:19.600
So looking forward to publishing that

103
00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:20.800
soon once I get enough of this

104
00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:21.420
stuff written out

105
00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:22.160
and out of my head.

106
00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:24.260
This was just a crude means for

107
00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.300
me to try and get the explanation

108
00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:27.640
out and get awareness

109
00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:29.540
set up so that other people can

110
00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:31.840
get more involved in open source software

111
00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:33.360
because I truly believe

112
00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:35.120
that decentralization and open source

113
00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:35.920
is the way to go.

114
00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:38.680
My name is Markizano Draconus, and

115
00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:40.340
I'm here to help you learn about

116
00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:41.440
IT and technology.

117
00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:42.980
And I look forward to seeing you

118
00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:43.800
on the next video.

119
00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:44.860
Thank you so much!
