1
00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:02.340
oh man this is too cool!

2
00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:03.460
no it's not me... I know I'm

3
00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:06.420
awesome, but if you if you...

4
00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:07.760
if you just...

5
00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:09.740
check out the gisty thingies and you

6
00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:10.380
go to find

7
00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:11.820
one of my gisty thingies it talks

8
00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.200
about voice2text: Yeah this here

9
00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:16.600
github

10
00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:18.340
gisty thingy talks about some fun

11
00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:19.460
stuff that you can do. You can

12
00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:20.060
take this Dockerfile,

13
00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:22.160
stash it in a file. Take

14
00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:23.880
this requirements.txt stash it in a file

15
00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:24.700
take the

16
00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:26.760
voice2text.py stash it in

17
00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.400
a file put the three of those

18
00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:29.700
in a directory run

19
00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:31.500
docker-build and you got yourself

20
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.240
a docker image run docker run you

21
00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:34.400
got

22
00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.800
yourself a docker tool that'll let

23
00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:41.100
you do voice to text I also

24
00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:41.780
happen to have

25
00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:44.780
blogged about it all right so this

26
00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:46.120
is a quick once over of the

27
00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:46.640
output that you

28
00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:48.020
can expect from it once you run

29
00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:49.820
the docker command what it's gonna

30
00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:50.800
do is

31
00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.140
it'll extract the audio from the video

32
00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:55.140
file that you gave it or the

33
00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:55.620
audio file

34
00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.000
that you gave it and it'll attempt

35
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.740
to translate all of that voice into

36
00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:02.220
text

37
00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:05.120
you can optionally output the results

38
00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:07.980
to an SRT file or you can

39
00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:09.020
output it so that

40
00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:10.740
it encodes it directly into the video

41
00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.680
as a subtitle stream. I personally

42
00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:15.100
like to

43
00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:16.960
extract them out to an SRT file

44
00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:18.780
I'll do a once over just to

45
00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:19.460
make sure everything

46
00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:21.720
translated over correctly and then

47
00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.620
I'll inscribe them onto the video

48
00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:24.120
itself

49
00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:26.220
through another filter using subtitles

50
00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.340
in FFmpeg. Credits to Guillaume for

51
00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.140
putting together Faster Whisper this

52
00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.480
project is awesome I just am standing

53
00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:34.680
on

54
00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.140
the shoulders of giants in this case

55
00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:37.700
all I did was wrap this code

56
00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:38.280
up inside of a

57
00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.020
docker container so that I could have

58
00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:43.120
this application itself in its own

59
00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:45.920
self-contained space what this lets

60
00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.780
me do is automatically translate and

61
00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:49.060
add

62
00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:51.240
subtitles to my videos in a streamlined

63
00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.700
fashion that does not require me to

64
00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:54.020
send

65
00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:55.700
them up to some cloud to pay

66
00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:57.380
for open AI and pay for CapCode

67
00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:58.580
possibly pay for

68
00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:59.920
CapCut if they ever turn that into

69
00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:02.780
a paid service only thing or something

70
00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:05.060
else you know I can control and

71
00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:06.560
manage and do all of that locally

72
00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:08.980
also not to

73
00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:10.660
mention it is a lot more accurate

74
00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:13.740
than CapCut and that's one of the

75
00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.960
first

76
00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:15.920
principles maintain your own data.
