1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.180
So let's talk about Local Admin Rights.

2
00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.020
But first, this is Pyrite. Element of

3
00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:09.900
fire and earth, tuned to the chakra

4
00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.020
of the solar plexus. Oftentimes represents

5
00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:16.780
manifestation and willpower and can

6
00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:19.660
be used as a good luck charm. Fascinating.

7
00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.560
I see a lot of security gurus

8
00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.940
out there talking about how they deny

9
00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:25.780
access to

10
00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:28.080
developers when they want admin rights

11
00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.240
to their local workstation. And I see

12
00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:32.480
some attempts at trying to make some

13
00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:35.040
explanations. Some of them make sense, but

14
00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.800
also some of them from the developers

15
00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.400
perspective probably still leave them

16
00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:41.760
wondering or feeling, why can't I

17
00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.200
have admin rights to my workstation?

18
00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:44.400
Well it

19
00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.540
comes from the principle of least

20
00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:48.680
privilege. You see, as someone who comes

21
00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:50.360
in and pretty much does line developer

22
00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:53.620
work, there isn't that much access that

23
00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:55.560
is really necessary for the engineer

24
00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:58.100
on their local workstation when they have

25
00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.100
access to a server environment that

26
00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:03.200
has the complete suite of all the software

27
00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:04.540
and everything they need running.

28
00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:07.720
Not to mention the structure and the

29
00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:08.140
setup that

30
00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:10.600
is required for having that particular

31
00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.320
application execute in whatever kind of

32
00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:14.580
environment they're using for their

33
00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.920
development. If you have done some

34
00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.920
modicum of software engineering at

35
00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:20.580
some point, you have run into the

36
00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:21.280
concept of

37
00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.980
dependencies. Your software oftentimes

38
00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:26.940
needs to install additional dependencies

39
00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:29.440
from other repositories. Somebody

40
00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:31.100
else has written that code, so why

41
00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.520
should you?

42
00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.060
Totally get it. Perfectly understandable.

43
00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:36.460
I'm a little late to this post because

44
00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:37.720
this has been published for quite

45
00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:40.440
some time, but it's important to understand.

46
00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:43.200
Hackers have gone out and they've

47
00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.680
actually infected these repositories. Now

48
00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:47.580
I'm not saying every package has been

49
00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:50.880
infected, and it's also not as simple as

50
00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.620
we'll just avoid those packages, right?

51
00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:56.800
Also, this is not a new concept either.

52
00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:59.160
This actually has been around for

53
00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:02.400
as long as code has existed. Hackers

54
00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:02.800
will go

55
00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:05.460
and they'll infect the packages and

56
00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.660
they may use this concept called

57
00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:09.800
typosquatting*, which is using those

58
00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:11.540
funny characters that are part of

59
00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.860
a Latin

60
00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:13.860
alphabet that look like the same character

61
00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.320
they represent. Like an "รก"

62
00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.260
You cannot just brush

63
00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:19.380
over the accent because you think

64
00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.660
it's a

65
00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:22.340
typo, right? No, it's called typosquatting,

66
00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:24.280
and it's something to pay attention to.

67
00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:25.980
If there's a package you're looking

68
00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:27.700
to install, you copy and paste the

69
00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:28.040
name of

70
00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:29.480
the website and it happens to have

71
00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:32.340
the name messed up or named very

72
00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:33.280
similar, you

73
00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:34.880
know, name the same package with a

74
00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:35.940
"-dev" at the end of it

75
00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:36.640
to indicate that it

76
00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:37.860
might be a developer's package of

77
00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.680
sorts. People do all kinds of things

78
00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:41.280
to get you

79
00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.940
to install malicious software. Well,

80
00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.780
what happens when that software hits your

81
00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:48.760
workstation? When your workstation

82
00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:51.340
is connected to the company VPN and your

83
00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:52.920
workstation can access the internal

84
00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.100
guts and the internal network of

85
00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:57.160
everything that the company needs

86
00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:58.160
as far as how it gets its

87
00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:59.840
work done? What if you

88
00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:01.580
as the developer, the engineer, had

89
00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:03.380
access to the production environment

90
00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:05.960
where we make our money, where our

91
00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:08.300
customer information is, where our

92
00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:11.120
PII, personally identifiable information,

93
00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:16.280
is stored? The risk of all of

94
00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:18.400
that coming down because the developer

95
00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.500
installed a bad package by accident, by

96
00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:24.040
intention, by bad copy and paste,

97
00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:28.540
by spoofing, who knows? In security,

98
00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:29.520
it's a

99
00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:32.980
matter of measuring the risk versus

100
00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:36.320
the protection of the data. If the

101
00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:37.360
risk is

102
00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:40.040
greater than the information we're

103
00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:42.380
trying to protect, then yeah, we're

104
00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:45.300
going to increase the cost of attack.

105
00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:47.460
And as far as I can tell,

106
00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:48.240
as far as my

107
00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:50.560
interpretation is concerned, security

108
00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:52.460
isn't about being completely blanketing,

109
00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:54.500
total, white glove;

110
00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:56.980
everything perfectly clean. It's about

111
00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:59.620
increasing the cost of attack to make

112
00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:02.460
it more expensive to exploit the system and

113
00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:03.540
to do something you're not supposed

114
00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:06.080
to, than it would be to use

115
00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.660
the application

116
00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:08.760
like it was supposed to, as it

117
00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:12.040
was intended. So in security, if I

118
00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:12.360
can make

119
00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:14.200
it really expensive to attack us,

120
00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:16.460
but really cheap to just use us,

121
00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:19.060
hey, that's a

122
00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:21.760
win-win, right? So the reason why

123
00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:24.360
you don't have admin rights on your local

124
00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:27.140
workstation is because it's too much

125
00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:28.580
of a risk to the company to

126
00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:29.480
allow you to be

127
00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:31.620
able to do that. Until, as an

128
00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:33.060
engineer, as a developer, and you

129
00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:33.900
get that senior rank

130
00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:35.520
and you are able to prove that

131
00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:38.520
you're diligent enough to protect yourself

132
00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:40.560
against exploits -- Actually I think

133
00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:42.300
it's just becoming a general practice more

134
00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:44.980
as time goes on. Because we've had

135
00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:47.480
far too many instances where employees get

136
00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:49.220
exploited. Companies are not treating

137
00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:50.780
their employees like they should be. So

138
00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:52.240
it makes it really easy to compromise

139
00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:54.080
the employees, get in their head,

140
00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:54.600
and get

141
00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:55.580
them to think that they can get

142
00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:56.660
back at the company for something.

143
00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:58.200
And it's just

144
00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:01.240
not worth the risk. So with that

145
00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:03.800
in mind, please have a little bit more

146
00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:06.640
patience with your security. Have

147
00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:08.780
a little bit more patience with those that

148
00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:11.460
are trying to balance the scales between,

149
00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:14.180
is it usable? Is it functional? Can

150
00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:15.000
I get my job done?

151
00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:16.000
Can I be effective?

152
00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:19.080
Can I be fast and still affordable?

153
00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:20.980
Versus, can I

154
00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:23.720
be compliant? Can I be secure? Because

155
00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:26.620
the most secure thing that you could

156
00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:27.100
ever do

157
00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:28.660
is just unplug the ethernet cable.

158
00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:32.360
Simple as that. But then you can't get

159
00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:34.920
anything done. So it's a toss-up.

160
00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:37.320
It's a balance between functionality and security.

161
00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:39.780
