1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.380
So let's talk about hacking and security.

2
00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:05.740
Now before we get started, I want

3
00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:05.940
to make

4
00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:07.580
sure you understand that Kizanos Fintech

5
00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:10.380
does not condone the use of hacking to

6
00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:11.960
steal some company's information,

7
00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:13.960
to deal damages to another person,

8
00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:14.460
to perform

9
00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.000
damage to IP or to some other

10
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.880
company. Please hack ethically outside

11
00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:19.240
of the

12
00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:21.200
context of a contractual agreement

13
00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:22.860
between you and the entity where you

14
00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:24.660
have their express permission to perform

15
00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.360
the operations discussed in this video.

16
00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:28.640
Don't do anything illegal. Don't be

17
00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:29.820
dumb. Don't do anything you're not

18
00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:30.280
supposed to.

19
00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:32.900
This is for edutainment purposes only.

20
00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.840
But first, black tourmaline has properties

21
00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:39.940
of the earth, is attuned to the

22
00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:42.420
root chakra, can purify your space,

23
00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:43.880
and also

24
00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:45.900
dons purification of the energies

25
00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:47.640
around you. It's a great traveling

26
00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:48.580
companion and

27
00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:51.300
one of my favorite stones. Fascinating,

28
00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.020
isn't it? So how does a website get

29
00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.000
hacked, you might be wondering. Well,

30
00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:59.160
you know this login screen accepts

31
00:00:59.160 --> 00:00:59.980
user input.

32
00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.900
And if someone's not careful and doesn't

33
00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:05.680
validate their input and escape their

34
00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:07.900
output before they take these text

35
00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:11.560
boxes and go and query the database, oftentimes

36
00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:14.020
people find SQL injections inside

37
00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:16.260
of these text boxes. Because a lot

38
00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:16.460
of the

39
00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:18.520
times people don't take the time to

40
00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:20.620
make sure that their output that's being

41
00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:22.820
that's coming from untrusted sources

42
00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:25.860
is sanitized and actually represents the

43
00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.240
data that they expect it to be.

44
00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.080
A lot of times hackers will go

45
00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:29.880
and find these

46
00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.500
inputs and have scripts that automatically

47
00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:34.320
go and attempt to inject

48
00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.400
them with input that the application

49
00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:39.480
wasn't expecting. So if as a software

50
00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:41.780
engineer you are not vigilant as far

51
00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:43.980
as making sure that untrusted information

52
00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:47.140
is sanitized and cleansed before sending

53
00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:49.460
it off to another source, you could be

54
00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:51.620
opening yourself up for exploit. And

55
00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:54.900
we all know and are probably quite annoyed

56
00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:57.320
with that captcha box that checks

57
00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:58.840
to make sure that you're actually human.

58
00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:00.980
Well, that's there to make sure that

59
00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:03.460
robots aren't able to continuously poke

60
00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:04.780
at the login page to see if

61
00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:06.660
they can try and authenticate. Because

62
00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:07.640
bots can't tell

63
00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.000
what those pictures are. And so this

64
00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.880
is a mechanism that is used to

65
00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:12.620
ensure that

66
00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:14.240
someone can't brute force your login.

67
00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:17.320
Because if you don't put some kind of

68
00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:19.420
barrier in place to make it difficult

69
00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:22.760
or rather to increase the cost of attack

70
00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:25.260
of trying to guess at someone's password,

71
00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:27.340
they can sit there and poke at

72
00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:27.640
your site

73
00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.320
all day long and you'll be none

74
00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:31.220
the wiser and eventually find a way

75
00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.680
to get in.

76
00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.040
And we all know about these arduous

77
00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.060
forms that tediously require us to

78
00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:39.500
enter this information in over and

79
00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:41.180
over again. Boy, I can't wait till

80
00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.620
we get one

81
00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:43.180
touch off where you just say bink

82
00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:44.860
and you know information is shared

83
00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:45.320
with who

84
00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:47.560
you specifically authorize, when you

85
00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.460
specifically authorize them, and for how

86
00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:51.100
long they get that access. But until

87
00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:53.060
that day comes around, we still got

88
00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:53.500
these text

89
00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:56.140
boxes to fill in. Did you know

90
00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:57.900
that these text boxes are also a

91
00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.240
treasure trove for hackers? They love

92
00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:02.800
to find these inputs. Why? Because

93
00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:03.640
it allows

94
00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:05.720
them to poke at the site and

95
00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:08.100
see what more can they do. Because

96
00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:08.860
if I can get

97
00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:10.860
your database to dump the contents

98
00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:13.700
of the user database table right here on

99
00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:16.500
the page, that's a treasure trove

100
00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:19.040
of information right there. If I can get

101
00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:21.220
your site to spit out a stack

102
00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:23.160
trace and show me where the files

103
00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:23.980
are on the file

104
00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:25.960
system, that's more information I

105
00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:27.820
can use in my reconnaissance to better

106
00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:29.760
understand the lay of the land within

107
00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:33.280
your current setup. If I can take these

108
00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:36.360
inputs and make your server do something

109
00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:39.620
that it wasn't intended to do, especially

110
00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:41.740
if I could take text from these

111
00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:44.060
boxes and put it into some kind

112
00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:44.720
of execution

113
00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:47.320
space. Because people sometimes love

114
00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:50.000
to take input from users and run

115
00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.460
it inside

116
00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:54.140
of an eval function or evaluate, which

117
00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:56.560
basically says take any string and

118
00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:59.360
execute it as code. That's extremely

119
00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:02.500
dangerous for unsanitized and unverified

120
00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:05.660
input from the end user. Why? Because

121
00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:07.480
I can get your server to go

122
00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:08.350
and download a

123
00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:10.070
malicious package and infect your

124
00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:12.870
site. I can convince your server to

125
00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:13.930
go out and do

126
00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:16.090
things on your behalf and it will

127
00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:17.850
look as if it's coming from your

128
00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:18.990
website. Now

129
00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:20.970
you're blacklisted. Now Google thinks

130
00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:23.070
you're a hacked website. Now you get the

131
00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:24.250
red banner at the top of the

132
00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:26.410
site or completely blocked altogether because

133
00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:28.350
you're not on the safe browsing list.

134
00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:31.870
So let's say a hacker got access

135
00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:32.310
to your

136
00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:34.510
server. They've got a compromise now.

137
00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:37.890
They found a way to get into your

138
00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:40.050
application and get it to execute

139
00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:42.650
some code that it wasn't expecting.

140
00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:44.250
Let's say

141
00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:45.830
there's a server out there that it

142
00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:48.210
already has access to. They've already

143
00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:51.010
compromised this server. What happens

144
00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:56.270
next? They can say, hey server, my new

145
00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:58.430
minion, I want you to go and

146
00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:00.650
download some infected software that

147
00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:01.130
I've got

148
00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:03.350
control of. And this software is going

149
00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:05.850
to give me more access to your

150
00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:08.970
systems. So if

151
00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:11.310
you have a fleet of servers that

152
00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:12.710
are sitting inside of your network

153
00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:13.730
and one

154
00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:16.950
of them gets compromised and now they've

155
00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:19.870
got control over it, they can go

156
00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:20.190
and get

157
00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:22.970
control to the rest of those servers

158
00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:26.550
as well. From this point they can

159
00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:27.030
do a

160
00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:29.390
network scan to see what that server

161
00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:31.370
can see as far as its internal

162
00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:31.910
network is

163
00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:34.030
concerned. So even though you may

164
00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:37.070
be behind a VPC, even though this particular

165
00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:39.030
server may be segmented off from the

166
00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:41.190
rest of the network, the servers that are

167
00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:43.190
inside of that local network are still

168
00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:46.470
possible to be compromised. This software

169
00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:49.570
that they've downloaded can now start

170
00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:53.150
a crypto miner and use and abuse the

171
00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:55.090
resources available to your system.

172
00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:58.990
It can deface your website such that any

173
00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:01.510
time somebody comes to visit it, they

174
00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:03.950
also get infected with malware. Be

175
00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:04.170
it on

176
00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:06.970
mobile, desktop, any kind of client

177
00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:09.410
that comes and accesses the server could

178
00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:11.610
become infected because it touched

179
00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:14.550
the infected server. Now what does that

180
00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:17.070
infected part mean? It means code

181
00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:20.050
executed outside of the context that it

182
00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:22.930
was designated to execute. So even

183
00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:25.190
though the program was running inside

184
00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:25.490
of the

185
00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:28.070
application on a server, somewhere

186
00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:30.970
in that program it evaluated a string

187
00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:31.670
and it

188
00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:34.330
broke execution context. And so now

189
00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:36.990
the application, that string that

190
00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:37.350
the hacker

191
00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:39.850
fed into the application told it,

192
00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:41.610
gave it the instructions it needed

193
00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:42.650
to go and do

194
00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:45.310
something it wasn't supposed to. So

195
00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:47.870
this is why things like protection against

196
00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:50.030
cross-site scripting or cross-site

197
00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:53.010
request forgery are important tactics to

198
00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:54.230
make sure that you use to protect

199
00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:56.890
yourself against exploit on the

200
00:06:56.890 --> 00:06:59.650
website's side. This is why the networking

201
00:06:59.650 --> 00:07:02.050
team is critical to ensure security

202
00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:04.570
against exploits because firewalls

203
00:07:04.570 --> 00:07:07.150
and other network partitions can prevent

204
00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:09.230
stuff like this from happening. Even

205
00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:12.010
though port 80 and 443 are open, you

206
00:07:12.010 --> 00:07:13.910
should also have an application firewall

207
00:07:13.910 --> 00:07:17.190
or even an outbound firewall to prevent

208
00:07:17.190 --> 00:07:19.770
your application, if it is compromised,

209
00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:22.670
from compromising things even further.

210
00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:24.690
And this is why in my networks

211
00:07:24.690 --> 00:07:26.530
I always run a two-way firewall.

212
00:07:26.910 --> 00:07:27.790
It's not just

213
00:07:27.790 --> 00:07:30.870
input, but also output. And so if

214
00:07:30.870 --> 00:07:32.930
I see something from within my network

215
00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:36.230
reaching out to some place like China,

216
00:07:36.410 --> 00:07:39.450
Russia, another country, a known hacked

217
00:07:39.450 --> 00:07:42.110
server, something's wrong. Something's

218
00:07:42.110 --> 00:07:45.330
wrong. And I've seen my internal firewalls

219
00:07:45.330 --> 00:07:48.050
block outbound traffic, preventing

220
00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:49.650
me from getting infected further.

221
00:07:50.430 --> 00:07:50.830
So it's

222
00:07:50.830 --> 00:07:52.290
important to keep that in mind as

223
00:07:52.290 --> 00:07:56.030
well. Network partitioning and segregating off

224
00:07:56.030 --> 00:07:58.830
your servers such that only your application

225
00:07:58.830 --> 00:08:00.010
servers would be impacted.

226
00:08:00.790 --> 00:08:02.670
Can you imagine if the database sat

227
00:08:02.670 --> 00:08:05.110
in the same location and that server got

228
00:08:05.110 --> 00:08:07.730
compromised as well? If they got access

229
00:08:07.730 --> 00:08:10.210
to the database and not talking about

230
00:08:10.210 --> 00:08:12.270
just talking to the database as a

231
00:08:12.270 --> 00:08:13.970
client, like a MySQL client or a

232
00:08:13.970 --> 00:08:14.750
MongoDB client,

233
00:08:14.750 --> 00:08:17.150
I'm talking about SSH or getting root

234
00:08:17.150 --> 00:08:19.070
access to the server behind the database.

235
00:08:19.970 --> 00:08:21.790
That's a very dangerous situation

236
00:08:21.790 --> 00:08:24.310
as well. We want to avoid that

237
00:08:24.310 --> 00:08:24.870
by making

238
00:08:24.870 --> 00:08:28.690
sure that we validate our input, sanitize

239
00:08:28.690 --> 00:08:30.910
and escape our output, make sure

240
00:08:30.910 --> 00:08:33.270
firewalls are in place to protect

241
00:08:33.270 --> 00:08:35.750
our systems so that people can't just

242
00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:37.830
willy-nilly connect to services that

243
00:08:37.830 --> 00:08:41.190
may be running on our servers. An application

244
00:08:41.190 --> 00:08:43.750
firewall that understands the input

245
00:08:43.750 --> 00:08:45.750
that's being received, so that if

246
00:08:45.750 --> 00:08:46.090
it were

247
00:08:46.090 --> 00:08:49.110
to perceive an injection attack or

248
00:08:49.110 --> 00:08:50.790
some kind of cross-request forgery

249
00:08:50.790 --> 00:08:52.070
attack, the

250
00:08:52.070 --> 00:08:54.170
application firewall itself would

251
00:08:54.170 --> 00:08:55.850
be intelligent enough to be able to figure

252
00:08:55.850 --> 00:08:57.830
that out and would better be able

253
00:08:57.830 --> 00:09:00.230
to protect your application from exploits.

254
00:09:00.850 --> 00:09:02.870
