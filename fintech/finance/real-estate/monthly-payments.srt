1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.960
So, I just asked ChatGPT to help

2
00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:04.300
me out with some real estate questions

3
00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:04.940
that I've got here

4
00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:06.980
and I just wanted to highlight some

5
00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:07.880
things for you here.

6
00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:11.560
I asked ChatGPT first if it could

7
00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:13.100
tell me what the average rate is

8
00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:15.100
for tax properties

9
00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:17.260
in Dallas and it turns out

10
00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:18.980
2.18% is about the average in

11
00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:20.640
North Dallas County.

12
00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:22.360
Okay, cool.

13
00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:23.920
So let's assume we got a $285,000

14
00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:26.140
house with a $20,000 payment.

15
00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:27.420
And the interest is going to be

16
00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.060
a 7.54% fixed for 30 years.

17
00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:31.940
What will the payments look like?

18
00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:33.820
Well, I was kind of shocked it

19
00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:35.240
actually gave me the equations and

20
00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.940
talked it through.

21
00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.420
The monthly payments for

22
00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:39.900
just the house by itself is going

23
00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:41.580
to be $1854.76.

24
00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:45.120
So with that in mind, let's say

25
00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.220
we had a 2.2% property

26
00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:49.620
tax in PMI until the loan has

27
00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:50.500
20% equity.

28
00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:52.160
What would the payments be then?

29
00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:54.980
Because I know I'm not (dumb) -- I know

30
00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:56.240
it ain't as simple as just paying

31
00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.760
on the house.

32
00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:58.420
You also got taxes, insurance and

33
00:00:58.420 --> 00:00:59.660
insurance on top of the insurance

34
00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:01.780
and well, I was grateful

35
00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:03.160
that we went through, you know, all

36
00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:04.620
of that as well and came to

37
00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:06.080
$2,487.

38
00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:07.620
Holy cow!

39
00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:10.700
I'm currently doing $1,572 for my

40
00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.440
apartment and this is a level of

41
00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:14.320
lifestyle inflation

42
00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:16.740
that I have just not seen before.

43
00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.100
How in the world?

44
00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.400
So, just to entertain the idea, let's

45
00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:22.600
say we drop the rates back down

46
00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.140
to 3.25%.

47
00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:25.920
What could that do to the monthly payments?

48
00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:28.860
Well, with PMI, insurance, taxes and

49
00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.080
all that fun stuff, it would drop

50
00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.460
the monthly

51
00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:33.720
payments down to $1,786, which is

52
00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:34.700
actually what I'm targeting.

53
00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:36.720
So I'm not wrong for looking for

54
00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.960
houses that are less than $285 because

55
00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:40.520
with a $20,000

56
00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.500
down payment and let's say I get

57
00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.980
to refinance with interest rates at

58
00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:47.060
a more reasonable amount,

59
00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:48.660
you know, 5 or 7 years from

60
00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:50.840
now, well, that's going to save me

61
00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:51.740
a ton of money later.

62
00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:55.340
So here's a breakdown, I just asked

63
00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:57.300
you to put together a table of

64
00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:58.020
what would happen

65
00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.220
for various house prices, what it

66
00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:02.660
would take for the $20,000 down

67
00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:03.440
payment that would be

68
00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:05.220
put in for it and then what

69
00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:06.860
would the monthly payments just look like.

70
00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:08.360
I understand these are just estimates,

71
00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:09.400
I know there's all kinds of other

72
00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:10.020
stuff to consider

73
00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.360
but just a ballpark figure to say,

74
00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:15.460
yeah, you buy a 3.25% house,

75
00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.780
you're going to be paying

76
00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:18.180
$2,100 a month.

77
00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:21.440
After tax tags and title, that's going

78
00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.500
to be $2,900 a month.

79
00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.860
That's almost $3,000, like that's

80
00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:28.180
twice the rent that I pay right

81
00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.380
now for a 3.25% house

82
00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:32.800
and a $20,000 down payment, that's

83
00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:33.920
just... WoW.

84
00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:38.560
So these values would be greatly affected

85
00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:40.460
if interest rates were lower.

86
00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:42.360
I noticed the one thing that really

87
00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:45.420
triggered a lower monthly payment

88
00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.160
is if the interest

89
00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:48.000
rates were lower.

90
00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.080
So everybody's talking about Wall

91
00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:51.600
Street's buying up houses and the

92
00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:52.440
housing market crash

93
00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.920
or whatever, blah blah blah, no, it's

94
00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:55.600
interest rates.

95
00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:57.380
They're really high right now and

96
00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:58.640
it's causing the monthly payments

97
00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:59.560
on houses to be really

98
00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:01.340
high, which is what's causing people

99
00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:03.840
to not want to move around as

100
00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:04.740
far as real estate

101
00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:05.260
is concerned.

102
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.760
Now, I'm not saying that that's every

103
00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:09.840
house deal ever, but like I'm just

104
00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:10.900
a guy who works

105
00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:12.860
in IT, who's been living in an

106
00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:14.160
apartment for the last five years

107
00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:15.000
and is ready to move

108
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.600
into a house.

109
00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:18.200
I've, you know, been in the same

110
00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:19.500
place and it just makes sense.

111
00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:20.260
It's like, why not?

112
00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:21.280
I'm going to be here a while,

113
00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:22.780
so why not?

114
00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:25.000
And as I really try to step

115
00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.820
into it, holy cow, wow, ummmm...
