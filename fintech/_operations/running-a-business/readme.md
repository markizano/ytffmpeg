# Running a Business

Greetings and welcome to Kizano's FinTech channel where I take you from zero to master in IT and
DevOps. In today's video I'm going to walk you through running a business because it's not just
the fly by the wheel thing you think it is.

Please be advised that I am not a lawyer or a tax advisor, so none of this is legal advice, nor tax advice.
Please be sure to consult with a lawyer before committing any of this to paper and be sure to do 
your own research. This is a summary of what I understand it takes to start a business in a generic 
high level sense. This will give you an idea of the gravity of the importance of some of the 
paperwork that is required to run a successful business if it's going to just be yourself.

Let's jump right in.

# Initialization

To start with the creation of a business, we need a few pieces of information to get us started:
- Name for the business
- Industry it will be
- Starting documentation

## Naming the Business
The name will be your branding so be sure to make it something meaningful, but also descriptive of
what the company does. You will need to know the industry the company operates in to complete the
paperwork required by the state and federal governments, respectively.
You wild also need some starting paperwork that will be required to fully describe your business.
Some states require this, some do not and only a form with a fee is sufficient.

## Selecting an Industry
For your business, it will be important to select the industry and type of work you will be providing.
Is it agriculture, science, services, technology? Whatever classifications are available in your state
will tell you what options you have. Select the one that most closely represents the business you will
be performing while in operation.

## Starting Documentation
It's good to describe these things anyways. The starting documentation you will need includes 3 main
pieces of information:
- Declarations page or pages that will define and describe your business, how it works and how it will
  serve a purpose, drive value and generate revenue.
- Authority page or pages that describe who is in charge and will be responsible for the company
  operations, direction and general management.
- Termination page describing what happens during company liquidations and wind-down. What happens
  to the company in order to properly clean things up after it's all said and done.

# Business Registration
Once we have this documentation, we can then take it a few places to have the next things finalized.
- Register with the state in which you are doing business, pay the fees and fill out the respective
  applications.
- Register for an EIN (Employer Identification Number). This will register your business as a separate
  entity with the IRS for tax reporting purposes. This is to ensure monies and assets are managed
  separate from your own finances.

## Employer Identification Number
First you will want to goto irs.gov and fill out the necessary forms and documentation to file for
an EIN or an Employer Identification Number. This number you will use in place of your social security
number when filing tax documents related to your business. In this way, you don't have to worry about
things being done directly in your name. They are done in a separate business account and reported
differently to the IRS because technically the money you have in your business belongs to the business.
As far as the IRS is concerned, the IRS is as real as a person, so keep that in mind.

# Banking
Awesome. Once you have your EIN and have registered your business by the state (and application was
approved), you can then take this to the bank and open a business checking account. In doing so, you
may be required to make a minimum deposit and maintain a minimum balance in order to avoid account
closure or fines and fees against your account. This can be as high as $5000 USD, could be as high as
$10,000 USD, which is a lot of money for some people. What's important is that you are able to separate
your own finances from your business finances and report them accordingly when it comes tax time.

## Tax Note
Speaking of tax time, did you know businesses must report their earnings quarterly? Yeah, that's right.
You have to report your taxes quarterly if you are a business. I think you can report annually, but it
is a lot more of a headache, so best to get it done every three months. We want to be legal and up
to date!

So keep in mind that filing your taxes quarterly will be an ongoing maintenance attrition on you with
your business. It's best to adopt an efficient process that will let you summarize your finances as
easily as possible.

## Deduction Note
What's nice about a business is that you can deduct your expenses from your earnings before having
to pay on any income made from the company. What's not so nice is you have to pay for both the
employer and employee tax on medicare, social security and payroll taxes. Expect to save at least 15%
of your income for this purpose.

# Congratulations Business Owner!
So, now that you have your EIN, your business registered with the state and your business checking
account open, congratulations, you are officially a business owner! This now gets you where you need
to be in order to begin to set yourself with payroll, employer based insurance if you want to provide
that to your employees and a bunch of other kewl benefits owning a company can afford you. Be sure
to track any money you take from the business because that will be considered an "owners withdrawal".
This is what you would have to file as income on your own taxes when it comes time to file.

# Disclaimers
Please be advised that this is not tax or legal advice. Please be sure to do your own research and
consult with the proper tax advisor or lawyer as per your situation requires. This post was created
