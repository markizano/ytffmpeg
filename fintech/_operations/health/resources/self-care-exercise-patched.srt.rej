 in your chair.
 
-17
+16
 00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:25.680
 You don't want to be leaning back
 
-18
+17

 in it too much because that'll lead
 
-19
+18
 00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:28.440
 you to bad posture.

 00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:38.420
 a justice as far
 
-26
+25
 00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:40.020
 as making sure that you are upright,
 
-27
-00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:41.760
+26
+00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:41.760
 your breath is just right.
 
-28
+27
 00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.360
 I make sure to be conscious of
 
-29
+28
 00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:45.460
 my breathing while I'm working and
 
-30
+29
 00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:46.480
 try not to get too lost
 
-31
-00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:47.720
+30
+00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:47.740
 into what it is I'm doing because
 
-32
-00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:50.400
+31
+00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:50.400
 oftentimes I fall too far into this.

-00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:52.640
+32
+00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.640
 So if that happens, there are some
 
-34
+33
 00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:53.940
 things you can do not only to
 
-35
+34
 00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.220
 maintain better posture,
 
-36
-00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:57.240
+35
+00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:57.240
 but also you can go get yourself
 
-37
+36
 00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:58.780
 some elastic bands.
 
-38
-00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:00.340
+37
+00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.340
 Typically what I'll do with these
 
-39
+38
 00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:01.980
 things is if I'm running a command,
 
-40
+39

 I make a build,
