1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.060
Now, as an expansion to my last

2
00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:03.540
video about this, I wanted to give

3
00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:04.220
you some things that

4
00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:05.660
you could actually use in your day

5
00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:06.480
-to-day exercises.

6
00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:08.400
If you're sitting here at your keyboard

7
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:09.640
and you're just waiting for a build

8
00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:10.040
to complete

9
00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:11.100
or you've got a couple of minutes

10
00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:12.780
here, what I'll typically do is I'll

11
00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:13.600
take this and I'll

12
00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:14.640
stretch it out to the sides.

13
00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:16.260
And what you want to do with

14
00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:17.560
that is you want to feel the

15
00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:18.820
muscles in your back connect.

16
00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:20.540
You're going to feel that stuff in

17
00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:21.880
the back of your head feel tight

18
00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:23.120
because you've been

19
00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.660
sitting here.

20
00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:25.100
These muscles in the back of the

21
00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:27.020
neck, like splenus capitis and splenus

22
00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:27.840
cervicis; they

23
00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.060
insert back here in the back of

24
00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:31.140
the spine -- I'm sorry, they *originate*

25
00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:31.380
in the back

26
00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:32.520
of the spine, they insert in the

27
00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:33.200
back of the head.

28
00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:35.320
They are responsible for keeping your

29
00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:37.400
head upright whenever you sit up straight.

30
00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:39.360
And with them being under a lot

31
00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:40.900
of strain and your head leaning forward,

32
00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:41.760
those muscles

33
00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.240
are tight because they've been sitting

34
00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:45.160
here trying to hold your head up.

35
00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:47.700
So give them a break, lean back

36
00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.320
a little bit and allow the rest

37
00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.340
of your body to take on

38
00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:51.520
the stress of your weight.

39
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.880
Whenever I grab one of these things,

40
00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:55.660
they vary in strength.

41
00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:57.840
For example, this is the easiest one.

42
00:00:57.980 --> 00:00:59.580
I mean, it's like a simple rubber band.

43
00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.360
This one takes a little bit more

44
00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:03.040
strength and is a little bit tighter.

45
00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:05.700
Use whatever resistance works for you.

46
00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:08.360
Just enough resistance is enough to

47
00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:08.920
get you started.

48
00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:10.260
You don't have to stress yourself.

49
00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:11.400
And whenever you feel comfortable

50
00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.940
and ready for it, you can definitely

51
00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:14.360
always add more

52
00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:14.840
later.

53
00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:18.040
So when you start off first, just

54
00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:20.760
connect with the body, just connect

55
00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:21.260
with what you

56
00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.640
feel.

57
00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:24.300
All right.

58
00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:26.520
So whenever I use the elastic bands,

59
00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.640
especially when it comes to exercises

60
00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:29.700
that involve using

61
00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.820
my feet, what I'll do is I

62
00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:36.220
don't like the band like this, because

63
00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:37.000
if you try and step

64
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.100
on this, you can hit one and

65
00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.380
the other and it just turns into a mess.

66
00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:43.180
So I do one loop, one crossing,

67
00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:45.200
so that way I can step on

68
00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:46.820
the X to keep myself from

69
00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:49.020
tripping on the elastic band.

70
00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:50.860
And when I do the bicep curls,

71
00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:53.320
I'm lifting up and I'm trying to

72
00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:54.520
connect with my arms.

73
00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:55.980
This is going to be great because

74
00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:57.400
it connects you not only with your

75
00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:59.180
biceps, but also the

76
00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:01.300
extensors in your forearms as well.

77
00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.220
You can curl your hands up and

78
00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:05.760
start to feel some of that tension

79
00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:07.040
from racketing on that

80
00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:07.860
keyboard all the time.

81
00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:10.800
You can also invert your hands, lift

82
00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.880
up as well, and you can start

83
00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:14.180
to feel some of those

84
00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:16.040
forearms starting to burn as well

85
00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:17.380
from using that mouse, I'm sure.

86
00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:20.900
I can also hit the long head

87
00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:22.460
of the biceps by hitting it outside.

88
00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:24.500
I can also do the short head

89
00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:26.100
of the biceps by hitting it on

90
00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.560
the inside.

91
00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:28.120
You can go online and look for

92
00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:31.980
the overlays of what the muscles of

93
00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:33.540
the body are, but these

94
00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:34.920
are typically used to make sure that

95
00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.800
I can continue typing effectively.

96
00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.960
Another really great one is to hang

97
00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:43.640
it across an overhead anchor and be

98
00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:45.740
able to pull down

99
00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:48.060
and work on the triceps as well.

100
00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:48.980
I kind of came up with this

101
00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:50.000
on the spot, but I suppose you

102
00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.680
could do this as well.

103
00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:53.480
This will make sure the backs of

104
00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:55.500
your arms are straight as well.

105
00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:58.540
Anytime I execute on one side of

106
00:02:58.540 --> 00:02:59.920
the muscle, you also need to hit

107
00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:00.860
the other side as well.

108
00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:02.420
If I do front side of the

109
00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:03.740
body, I do back side of the body.

110
00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:06.040
If I do biceps, I also do triceps.

111
00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:08.500
If I do quads, I also do hamstrings.

112
00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:10.600
You don't want to have one side

113
00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:12.440
of your body also left and right

114
00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.840
as well.

115
00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:14.200
You don't want to have one side

116
00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.060
of your body, front, back, left, right,

117
00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:16.580
it doesn't matter.

118
00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:18.420
You don't want to have one side

119
00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:20.300
of your body stronger, tighter, or

120
00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:21.840
any more than the other.

121
00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:23.420
I try to do this to maintain

122
00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:26.640
consistency such that I can keep doing

123
00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:27.700
my job because I want

124
00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:28.300
to keep getting paid.

125
00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:29.160
I don't want to be stuck in

126
00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:30.600
a hospital bed all day long doing stuff.

127
00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:34.020
When it comes to the exercise ball,

128
00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:35.140
this one is a little bit different.

129
00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.220
I have probably a mid-sized one.

130
00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:39.300
I think this was a 50 to

131
00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:40.080
55 inch one.

132
00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:42.620
Basically, I anchor my feet into the

133
00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:45.220
wall, I lay down on the exercise ball.

134
00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:47.700
You'll feel this as soon as you

135
00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:51.460
lay down, how the stretch and the

136
00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:52.540
connection to the

137
00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:53.480
back of the body is.

138
00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:56.120
This will do you wonders.

139
00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:58.000
This is all I do, probably about

140
00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.040
5 to 10 of these a day,

141
00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:00.500
where I just lay on the ball

142
00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.080
and I connect myself.

143
00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:03.480
I say, how do you feel?

144
00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:07.380
Now, if you do this and this

145
00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:08.440
is as far as you can get,

146
00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:09.460
don't worry about it.

147
00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:10.120
It's okay, honey.

148
00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:12.620
You'll, you'll, it'll take some time.

149
00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:14.440
Your body is waking up.

150
00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:16.260
You've never used it before, just

151
00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:16.780
like the Matrix.

152
00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:18.000
Why does his eyes hurt so bad?

153
00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:20.020
Because he never used them before.

154
00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:20.900
It's okay.

155
00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:23.340
Once you connect and work with your

156
00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:25.380
body, it will work with you.

157
00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.240
And eventually you'll be able to reach

158
00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:29.600
all the way up and get that

159
00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:31.300
full extension in

160
00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:31.620
the back.

161
00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:34.600
Same thing with the front side as well.

162
00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:38.860
Now, I will anchor my feet into

163
00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:40.480
the wall, lean on the ball.

164
00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:42.380
This will allow me to lay back.

165
00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:44.760
You can feel the stretch in the

166
00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:47.480
spine and you can use that to

167
00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:49.020
raise yourself up.

168
00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:52.860
And basically all I'm doing is connecting

169
00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:53.600
with the body.

170
00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:56.620
Now, I also want to caveat here,

171
00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:58.760
I am not turning this into a

172
00:04:58.760 --> 00:04:59.340
workout channel.

173
00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:02.440
This is an absolutely critical part

174
00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:03.400
of your day.

175
00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:05.720
This is something you need to incorporate

176
00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:06.840
into your lifestyle.

177
00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:10.220
This is a change in the ways

178
00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:11.760
in which you get stuff done.

179
00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:13.480
Because if you can't take care of

180
00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:14.760
the body, if you don't take care

181
00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:16.200
of the self, it will

182
00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:18.180
fail on you and it will hurt

183
00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:20.720
and it will be miserable and you're

184
00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:21.420
not going to like it.

185
00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:24.800
So if you incorporate these changes

186
00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:27.100
into your day to day, as part

187
00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:28.420
of your job, as part of

188
00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:31.020
your world, in IT, because sitting

189
00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:32.580
in that chair all day long is

190
00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:33.460
a death sentence.

191
00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:35.020
I can guarantee you this.

192
00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:37.820
Don't sit in the chair all day long.

193
00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:40.540
You have other aspects of life that

194
00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:42.140
you can and should incorporate.
