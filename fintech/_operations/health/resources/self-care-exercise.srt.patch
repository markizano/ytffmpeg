-16

 You don't want to be leaning back

+18

 a justice as far
 
-25
+26
 00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:40.020
 as making sure that you are upright,

-00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:41.760
+27
+00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:41.760
 your breath is just right.
 
-27
+28
 00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.360
 I make sure to be conscious of
 
-28
+29
 00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:45.460
 my breathing while I'm working and
 
-29

 into what it is I'm doing because

-00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:50.400
+32
+00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:50.400
 oftentimes I fall too far into this.

-00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.640
+33
+00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:52.640
 So if that happens, there are some
 
-33
+34
 00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:53.940
 things you can do not only to
 
-34
+35
 00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.220
 maintain better posture,
 
-35
-00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:57.240
+36
+00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:57.240
 but also you can go get yourself
 
-36
+37
 00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:58.780
 some elastic bands.

-00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.340
+38
+00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:00.340
 Typically what I'll do with these
 
-38

-00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:17.020
-wind it up so I can bring
+00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:15.280
+sort of wind it up
 
 110
-00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:17.520
-it back home.
+00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:16.220
+so I can bring it back home.
 
 111
-00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.220
+00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:18.940
 When I first started at 28, I
 
 112
-00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:22.220
+00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:20.960
 said, whatever habits I carry with
 
 113
-00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:23.240
-me into my 30s,
+00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:22.540
+me into my 30s, I will
 
 114
-00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.440
-I will carry them past my 30s.
+00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:24.140
+carry them past my 30s.
 
 115
-00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:26.960
+00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:25.700
 So we need to make a change
 
 116
-00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:27.440
+00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:26.160
 right now.
 
 117
-00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:29.260
+00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:27.980
 And I was probably just like you,
 
 118
-00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:31.300
-sitting doing this all day.
+00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:31.200
+sitting doing this all day, all day,
 
 119
-00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:34.880
-All day, 16 hours a day! (as
+00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:32.120
+16 hours a day,
 
 120
-00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:35.440
-much as I could :smirk:)
+00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:34.180
+as much as I could.
 
 121
-00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:38.220
+00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:36.940
 And then at some point I said,
 
 122
-00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:39.860
+00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:38.600
 no, I need to take care of myself.
 
 123
-00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:43.560
+00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:42.300
 And what's easiest for me is first
 
 124
-00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:44.040
-thing in the morning,
+00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:43.640
+thing in the morning before my brain
 
 125
-00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:45.760
-before my brain has a chance to
+00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:44.300
+has a chance
 
 126
-00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:47.460
-convince me I should not do this.
+00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:46.220
+to convince me I should not do this.
 
 127
-00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:49.200
+00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:47.940
 I get my shoes on, I get
 
 128
-00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:50.620
-my gear together, and I go for
+00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:49.360
+my gear together and I go for
 
 129
-00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:51.220
+00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:49.960
 a jog.
 
 130
-00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:53.240
+00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:51.960
 And when I go for the jog,
 
 131
-00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:55.600
-I used to just run until I
+00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:53.740
+it's, you know, I used to just
 
 132
-00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:56.800
-felt tired, and
+00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:55.520
+run until I felt tired and
 
 133
-00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:57.720
+00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:56.460
 then just stop for a second.
 
 134
-00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:00.420
-Also, when I first started, I started
+00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:59.120
+Also when I first started, I started
 
 135
-00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:01.780
-with 300ft maybe,
+00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:01.880
+with 300 feet, maybe barely making
 
 136
-00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:04.080
-barely making it out the parking lot,
+00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:02.260
+it out the
 
 137
-00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:06.220
-barely making it five to seven minutes,
+00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.360
+parking lot, barely making it five
 
 138
-00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:09.620
-if that, but I didn't wanna kill myself.
+00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:05.720
+to seven minutes, if that.
 
 139
-00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:11.940
-Far too many people I saw trying
+00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:08.360
+But I didn't want to kill myself.
 
 140
-00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:13.420
-to start off like an Olympian, and
+00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:10.680
+Far too many people I saw trying
 
 141
-00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.500
-I'm sorry, what you do is you
+00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:11.780
+to start off like an Olympian.
 
 142
-00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:19.980
-start off with very baseline basic minimums.

+And that just don't work.
 
 143
-00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:21.360

+What you do is you start off
 
 145

-push yourself just enough to say,

+with very baseline basic minimums
 
 146
-00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:26.320
-well, I just wanna focus on consistency.
