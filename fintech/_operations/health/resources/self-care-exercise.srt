1
00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:03.180
Now, when it comes to working from

2
00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:05.420
home or working in the office, I

3
00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:06.020
try to make sure

4
00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:07.140
that I take care of my body.

5
00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:08.480
Because if I don't take care of

6
00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:10.517
me, how can I take care of the company?

7
00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:12.100
(or anything else for that matter)?

8
00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:13.580
So one of the few things that

9
00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:14.780
I do in order to make sure

10
00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:16.360
that I can continue chugging

11
00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:18.780
away here at the keyboard is, for

12
00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:20.900
1: make sure that your posture is right.

13
00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:21.920
You want to make sure that your

14
00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:23.540
back is straight and that you're comfortable

15
00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:24.160
in your chair.

16
00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:25.680
You don't want to be leaning back

17
00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.300
in it too much because that'll lead

18
00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:28.440
you to bad posture.

19
00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:30.340
I have learned through my trials with

20
00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:32.460
massage therapy that (also through

21
00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:33.120
physically holding

22
00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.520
my stance correctly), sitting in your

23
00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.460
chair upright definitely does you

24
00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:38.420
a justice as far

25
00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:40.020
as making sure that you are upright,

26
00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:41.760
your breath is just right.

27
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.360
I make sure to be conscious of

28
00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:45.460
my breathing while I'm working and

29
00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:46.480
try not to get too lost

30
00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:47.740
into what it is I'm doing because

31
00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:50.400
oftentimes I fall too far into this.

32
00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.640
So if that happens, there are some

33
00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:53.940
things you can do not only to

34
00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.220
maintain better posture,

35
00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:57.240
but also you can go get yourself

36
00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:58.780
some elastic bands.

37
00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.340
Typically what I'll do with these

38
00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:01.980
things is if I'm running a command,

39
00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:02.860
I make a build,

40
00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:04.620
I'm waiting on code to compile, I'm

41
00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:06.120
waiting on a server to finish kicking off.

42
00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:08.340
I'll take one of these bands and

43
00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:09.060
just stretch.

44
00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:11.500
And when I go to work out,

45
00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.240
when I do a proper workout, it's

46
00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:15.740
not this pump, pump.

47
00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.000
I got to get all alpha male.

48
00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.140
"Give me my big muscles" business...

49
00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:19.680
No, no, no, no, no honey,

50
00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.520
no, no, no, darling... *tsk tsk*

51
00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.540
It's more of a meditation thing for me.

52
00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.060
It's more of a connect your mind

53
00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.080
to your body.

54
00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:29.800
And I just want to say triceps:

55
00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:30.840
Good morning.

56
00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:31.640
"How are you doing today?"

57
00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:36.020
"Trapezius, how are you doing?"

58
00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:40.220
Rhomboids, teres minor...

59
00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.680
I want to connect to the muscles

60
00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:45.220
in the back, identify them, and

61
00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:47.180
feel my brain clinch on them for

62
00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:47.660
just a minute.

63
00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:49.400
Feel the tension.

64
00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.280
If you do this and it feels

65
00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:53.680
tight or it doesn't feel right,

66
00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:55.640
don't go grabbing the pills.

67
00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:57.980
I'm sorry, Ibuprofen, Tylenol, Advil.

68
00:01:58.460 --> 00:01:59.880
No, honey, we don't need you up

69
00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:00.180
in here.

70
00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:01.200
We got exercise.

71
00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:03.520
The pain in your body that you're

72
00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:06.300
experiencing is a signal that you

73
00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:06.580
need to

74
00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:09.920
get off your donkey and do something

75
00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:10.920
different for a minute.

76
00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:13.320
The hurt that you're feeling is because

77
00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:14.600
you're sitting here stale for

78
00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:15.280
hours in a day.

79
00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:16.480
That's not good.

80
00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:17.560
That's not healthy.

81
00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:20.540
I also have myself an exercise ball.

82
00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.520
I use that at times for core workouts.

83
00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.220
I prop myself against the wall, lean

84
00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:27.320
on the ball, and

85
00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:30.020
reach up to the sky to feel

86
00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:31.760
the muscles in the back.

87
00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:33.680
And then I may also lay on

88
00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.840
my back so that I can do

89
00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:37.840
more than just crunches.

90
00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.260
I want to feel the entire torso, and

91
00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:41.700
I want to connect to everything that

92
00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:42.260
I have here.

93
00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:43.060
Why?

94
00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:46.600
Because a healthy body is a healthy environment.

95
00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:49.880
And if you are better connected to

96
00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:52.200
your body, and if you feel good

97
00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:52.780
in your own

98
00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:55.080
skin, I promise you, your work day

99
00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:56.180
is gonna be so much better.

100
00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.740
And then for cardio, I go jogging.

101
00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:01.820
Now, it also took me 5 years

102
00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:02.620
to get to where I am.

103
00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:04.420
It took me 5 years to get

104
00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:06.860
to a point where 3 miles is comfortable.

105
00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:08.920
That 1st mile is a warm up....

106
00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.260
The 2nd mile feels like I'm really working.

107
00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:12.880
The third mile is about where I

108
00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:14.280
start to taper down and kind of

109
00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:15.280
sort of wind it up

110
00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:16.220
so I can bring it back home.

111
00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:18.940
When I first started at 28, I

112
00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:20.960
said, whatever habits I carry with

113
00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:22.540
me into my 30s, I will

114
00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:24.140
carry them past my 30s.

115
00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:25.700
So we need to make a change

116
00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:26.160
right now.

117
00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:27.980
And I was probably just like you,

118
00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:31.200
sitting doing this all day, all day,

119
00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:32.120
16 hours a day,

120
00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:34.180
(as much as I could).

121
00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:36.940
And then at some point I said,

122
00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:38.600
"No, I need to take care of myself."

123
00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:42.300
And what's easiest for me is first

124
00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:43.640
thing in the morning before my brain

125
00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:44.300
has a chance

126
00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:46.220
to convince me I should not do this.

127
00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:47.940
I get my shoes on, I get

128
00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:49.360
my gear together and I go for

129
00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:49.960
a jog.

130
00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:51.960
And when I go for the jog,

131
00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:53.740
it's, you know, I used to just

132
00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:55.520
run until I felt tired and

133
00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:56.460
then just stop for a second.

134
00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:59.120
Also when I first started, I started

135
00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:01.880
with 300 ft, maybe... barely making

136
00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:02.260
it out the

137
00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:05.720
parking lot, barely making it 5-7 mins, if that...

138
00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:05.720
 

139
00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:08.360
But I didn't want to nix myself.

140
00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:10.680
Far too many people I saw trying

141
00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:11.780
to start off like an Olympian.

142
00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:12.880
And that just don't work.

143
00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:13.620
I mean, I'm sorry.

144
00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:16.580
What you do is you start off

145
00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:18.700
with very baseline basic minimums

146
00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:20.000
and you start with just what

147
00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.420
you can handle and push yourself just

148
00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:23.900
enough to say, well, I just want

149
00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:25.040
to focus on consistency.

150
00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:26.840
I don't care how far I go.

151
00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:28.560
I don't care how strong I get.

152
00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:31.740
I just want to consistently pay my body.

153
00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:34.860
It's minimum wage it needs in order

154
00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:35.540
to survive.

155
00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:37.460
I don't care about being an Olympian.

156
00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:38.920
I don't care about being the next

157
00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:39.500
Arnold Schwarzenegger.

158
00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:42.400
I care about taking care of "The

159
00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:45.140
Self". The biggest driving motivating

160
00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:46.600
factor that gets

161
00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:49.200
me off my fanny is that hospital

162
00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:51.100
bed, them stack of pills.

163
00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:52.780
I do not want to be 50

164
00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:55.560
years old, taking 9,000 pills, sitting

165
00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:57.240
in a hospital bed, unable to

166
00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:58.800
do anything or to contribute to society.

167
00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:01.700
I need to be able to take

168
00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:03.820
care of self so that I can

169
00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:06.360
take care of and provide for others.

170
00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:09.660
That's the motivation behind what

171
00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:11.260
gets me going, what gets me moving.

172
00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:15.060
And if this helps you to change

173
00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:18.500
your perspective about what healthy

174
00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:20.000
exercise and what it looks

175
00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.500
like to take care of The Self,

176
00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:25.400
it's a whole lot different than, Oh,

177
00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:26.960
you know, I gotta

178
00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:29.000
get all beefy and blah, blah, blah,

179
00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:31.127
no, honey... ;)

180
00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:32.220
that's some

181
00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:32.680
alpha stuff.

182
00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:33.620
You need to put that muffin off

183
00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:34.120
to the side.

184
00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:35.180
We ain't going to be dealing with that.

185
00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:36.640
This is some meditation stuff.

186
00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:37.860
This is gonna make you feel good.

187
00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:40.260
