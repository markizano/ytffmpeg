1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.580
So let's talk about Git, the stupid

2
00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:04.480
content tracker.

3
00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:07.700
Oh, and this isn't me making this up.

4
00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:09.860
It's in the documentation itself.

5
00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:10.760
That's what it's called.

6
00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:12.660
And also a slight little correction

7
00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:13.140
to myself

8
00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:14.320
before I was calling it the stupid

9
00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:14.980
file tracker.

10
00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:16.960
It's actually called the stupid content tracker.

11
00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.900
Apologies for that.

12
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:20.720
Recognize this from my last video?

13
00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:22.720
If you don't, go check them out.

14
00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:24.080
See, here's the thing.

15
00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.960
The challenge that I face with most engineers

16
00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:28.920
is they think Git is hard.

17
00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.560
It's difficult to understand.

18
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.560
Yes, I understand there's a lot of

19
00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:33.540
curves and turns,

20
00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:35.460
but it's not that difficult

21
00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.520
once you set yourself in a process,

22
00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:39.080
get yourself in a routine,

23
00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:41.580
and execute on some patterns

24
00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:44.060
so that those wires that grow together

25
00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.720
in your mind

26
00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:46.980
will continue to build stronger and

27
00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:47.660
get better

28
00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:50.020
as far as how you control how

29
00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:50.980
your code is edited.

30
00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.600
So we'll start off with a basic premise

31
00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.620
of we've got a new feature that's

32
00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:56.080
coming in

33
00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:57.500
or a new ticket that's come in,

34
00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:58.940
and we need to make some changes

35
00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:00.340
to that particular ticket

36
00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:02.120
before they can be pushed back into

37
00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:02.940
the develop branch

38
00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.940
to get promoted to the upper environments.

39
00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:07.980
So the idea is you branch from

40
00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:08.860
the develop branch

41
00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:10.300
into your ticket branch,

42
00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:12.760
make your changes in that ticket branch,

43
00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:15.200
and then merge them back into the

44
00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:16.120
develop branch.

45
00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:17.440
Now, if you're a cowboy, you can

46
00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:18.480
just use git merge

47
00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:19.780
because you're the only guy that's

48
00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:20.500
working on the project,

49
00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:21.680
so what do you need to do

50
00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:22.640
the whole process for?

51
00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:24.860
Now, if you're part of a development team,

52
00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.260
what's going to need to happen,

53
00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:27.940
at least for an efficient setup

54
00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:29.400
that's going to lead you to the

55
00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:30.700
best product possible,

56
00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:33.480
is you open a pull request from

57
00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:34.320
your ticket branch

58
00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:35.960
into the develop branch.

59
00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:37.500
What does the pull request do?

60
00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:40.140
Well, it basically opens a conversation up

61
00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.840
between you and the other engineers

62
00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:43.540
for all of you to come together,

63
00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:45.120
or however many of you needs to

64
00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:45.640
come together

65
00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:47.580
to review those changes

66
00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:50.460
to ensure that they honor your coding standards

67
00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.400
and also to ensure that the structure

68
00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:54.040
of the code

69
00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:55.060
matches what you need,

70
00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:57.020
the business requirements have been met,

71
00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:59.040
and everything that needs to be done

72
00:01:59.040 --> 00:01:59.800
in this ticket

73
00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.180
and whatever changes need to be implemented

74
00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:04.120
have been done to satisfaction

75
00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:06.200
by the local engineering team.

76
00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:08.160
You merge that into the develop branch,

77
00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:09.480
and we proceed on to the next

78
00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:11.240
step in the SDLC process.

79
00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.000
Similarly, for feature branches

80
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.780
that may include more than just a

81
00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:17.520
couple of changes

82
00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:20.160
or may involve just a few more discussions

83
00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.420
than just a simple little quick ticket change,

84
00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:24.040
sometimes you might be coming out

85
00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:25.220
with a full-blown feature,

86
00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:26.860
and this feature might need to be

87
00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:27.360
broken down

88
00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:28.560
into smaller components

89
00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.120
so that those smaller pieces can be

90
00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:32.020
executed on,

91
00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:33.800
those changes can be made to the code,

92
00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:34.900
they can be tested

93
00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:36.740
and run through their own little mini process,

94
00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:39.240
and then get merged back into the

95
00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:40.000
develop branch

96
00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.420
for the next parts that are gonna

97
00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.200
come in the SDLC process.

98
00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:47.160
SDLC is Software Development Lifecycle.

99
00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:50.340
Thanks to TikTok's short-term attention span,

100
00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:51.520
that's all you're gonna get for now.

101
00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:52.960
Wanna know some more about how this

102
00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:53.660
works in QA?

103
00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:54.900
You're gonna have to subscribe

104
00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.080
