1
00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:03.860
So let's talk about Git, the stupid

2
00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:04.640
file tracker.

3
00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:06.800
So if you don't know what Git is,

4
00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:07.940
any of this or that and the other,

5
00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:09.620
what's going on, I've never seen this before,

6
00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:11.580
I have other videos, you should go

7
00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:12.140
check those out.

8
00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:13.560
I'm going to assume you've watched those

9
00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:14.440
before you come to this one.

10
00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:16.420
If not, save it for later, go

11
00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:16.800
watch those,

12
00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:17.820
come back, see this one.

13
00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:18.780
Pause for now.

14
00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:21.280
All right, great, thanks, we'll continue on.

15
00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:22.980
So we're gonna talk about some basic

16
00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.240
slash advanced concepts here.

17
00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:26.820
When you make a change to your code,

18
00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:27.940
you've been making your edits,

19
00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:29.320
you've been making your updates,

20
00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:31.020
you wanna share this with somebody else,

21
00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:32.500
and so now you have your code

22
00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:33.500
sitting in this repository.

23
00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:35.700
You've committed your changes, you've

24
00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:36.220
pushed, you've pulled,

25
00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.140
you get the basic concepts of the Git

26
00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:41.220
and how version control software works, VCS.

27
00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.080
What now?

28
00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.600
Well, this branching strategy.

29
00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:47.380
You're gonna hear about this in development

30
00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:49.440
because it is closely and heavily

31
00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.240
tied to the SDLC,

32
00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:53.200
or the software development lifecycle.

33
00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.000
So in this video, we're gonna talk

34
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:55.700
about branching,

35
00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:57.620
and specifically, what does that mean?

36
00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:59.400
Because a branch is in your head.

37
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.700
A branch, like a tag, is an

38
00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:03.500
annotation, a name of sorts,

39
00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:05.840
that represents a line of changes

40
00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:07.660
that we are making upon a particular

41
00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:08.240
code base.

42
00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:09.700
You have master, you have staging.

43
00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.140
You may also have development,

44
00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:12.260
and may also be a third branch.

45
00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:13.460
I'm gonna cover that in a future video.

46
00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:15.800
So as you are making changes to

47
00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:16.420
your files,

48
00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.220
and you run the command git commit,

49
00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.300
you're basically creating little checkpoints

50
00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.900
in time

51
00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:23.440
where your code exists in that state,

52
00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:25.460
at that time that you made that commit.

53
00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:28.020
An entire full version copy of the code,

54
00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:30.660
as it exists in this moment, exists

55
00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:31.700
in that commit.

56
00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:33.140
And you can make those commits

57
00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:34.780
along these lines of changes.

58
00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:36.600
Now, if you come into a situation

59
00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:37.580
where you have two people

60
00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:38.980
that want to contribute to a project,

61
00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:41.020
and say they're making changes to

62
00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:42.120
different sets of files,

63
00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:43.660
and you want to keep them in sync,

64
00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.560
but they may not be working on something

65
00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:48.340
that is directly related to the same changes,

66
00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:49.700
then what you can do is you

67
00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:50.840
can create a separate branch

68
00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:52.820
that you can use to stage your changes.

69
00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:54.660
So you would then make your changes

70
00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:56.120
to the staging branch.

71
00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:57.860
Both of you would contribute and commit

72
00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:58.500
to that branch.

73
00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:00.100
And when you're ready to make a release,

74
00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:01.100
you would take that and you would

75
00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.500
merge it

76
00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:02.920
into the master branch.

77
00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:04.920
In this way, you will be able

78
00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:05.960
to make changes

79
00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.880
in a non-intrusive way that allows you

80
00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:11.040
to make the changes on some other branch,

81
00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:12.400
some other place where somebody else

82
00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:13.920
isn't actively watching you making

83
00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:14.480
those changes.

84
00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:16.380
You can do that on a separate branch

85
00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.360
and merge them on up into the

86
00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.960
master branch.

87
00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.260
So yep, I'm gonna cap it right there.

88
00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:22.980
This is gonna be about merging.

89
00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:25.920
Simply taking changes from a different line

90
00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.900
of changes in a branch and you

91
00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:28.460
merge that

92
00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:30.020
into another branch.

93
00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:31.640
Keep in touch, subscribe,

94
00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:32.800
because I got more videos coming out.

95
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.100
I'm gonna play these in short form

96
00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:35.060
so that you can get some really

97
00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:35.620
quick content,

98
00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:37.300
and then we'll just keep talking about

99
00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:37.740
these subjects

100
00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:38.500
until you're an expert.
