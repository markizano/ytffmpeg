1
00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:03.880
So let's talk about Git, the stupid

2
00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:04.820
content tracker.

3
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:06.600
Now, if you don't know anything about

4
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:07.340
what I'm talking about,

5
00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:08.600
I have other videos to get you

6
00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.900
caught up

7
00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:09.660
on what's going on.

8
00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:11.220
In the meantime, I'm going to assume

9
00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:12.500
that you've watched those other videos

10
00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:14.580
and you know just about what Git is.

11
00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:16.560
So here's the thing, you've been editing

12
00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:17.120
this code,

13
00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:18.100
you know how to commit,

14
00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:19.880
you know how to push your changes

15
00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:20.440
to the remote,

16
00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.060
you know how to pull someone else's

17
00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:22.720
changes down,

18
00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:24.580
you understand the fundamental concept

19
00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:25.360
of a branch

20
00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:27.300
and how it is a line of

21
00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:28.780
thinking or a line of commits

22
00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:30.460
that you're making to a particular

23
00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:31.740
set of changes.

24
00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:35.380
So here's the flow, here's the juicy stuff,

25
00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:36.840
here's the boss battle.

26
00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:38.620
We're gonna understand this whole

27
00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:39.600
control flow

28
00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.700
as far as how a software development lifecycle

29
00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:45.760
will complete itself in a project team.

30
00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:47.860
This is the stuff they don't teach

31
00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:48.500
you in college

32
00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:50.240
and companies want you to know this

33
00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:51.480
so that you can be efficient in

34
00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:52.320
getting your work done.

35
00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:53.840
And again, of course, I didn't really

36
00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:55.000
learn much from college

37
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.220
anyways, because it was just high

38
00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:56.960
school all over again,

39
00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:58.200
but anyways, that's a side of the point.

40
00:00:58.780 --> 00:00:59.820
Here's the thing, you're going to

41
00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.320
have a set of branches,

42
00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:03.340
a series of branches that are going

43
00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:03.960
to represent

44
00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.160
a set of changes.

45
00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.360
The master branch, typically for production releases.

46
00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:10.240
This is supposed to mimic what is

47
00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:10.980
in production,

48
00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:12.540
what is in that environment that is

49
00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:13.340
making you money.

50
00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:15.780
What is the source of truth for

51
00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:16.980
whatever will be

52
00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:19.100
the final result of the code that

53
00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:20.020
is currently operating

54
00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:21.460
and doing stuff in the environment.

55
00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:24.900
Staging, sometimes called UAT or user

56
00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.000
acceptance testing.

57
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.980
This is where we present changes,

58
00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.160
we stage them to make them in production,

59
00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:31.940
we pass them off to the customer

60
00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:32.380
to say,

61
00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.500
hey, are the changes that you asked

62
00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:35.060
us to make

63
00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:37.440
in this particular project complete

64
00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:38.380
to your satisfaction

65
00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:40.260
and do you approve of these changes

66
00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:41.960
before we publish them into production

67
00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:43.760
to make the money off of the software

68
00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:45.300
that we are developing for you.

69
00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:48.600
The develop branch is where most of

70
00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:49.560
the engineering

71
00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:50.600
is taking place.

72
00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.680
This is where we've taken requirements

73
00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:53.660
from the customer,

74
00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:55.460
brought them into the engineering team,

75
00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:57.560
identified what code changes need

76
00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:58.100
to be made

77
00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:00.620
and then publishing them on the develop branch

78
00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:02.480
so that other engineers will be able

79
00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:03.040
to test

80
00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:05.020
and operate on them within this full

81
00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:06.020
SDLC process

82
00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:07.280
that we're gonna go over in a

83
00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.780
future video.

84
00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:09.880
I also like to set up the

85
00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:11.100
premise of ticket branches

86
00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:13.000
or feature branches because these

87
00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.240
are short-lived branches

88
00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:16.540
that will serve only a couple of commits

89
00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.620
before making your changes and merging them

90
00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.040
into the higher branches.

91
00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:23.080
Because TikTok is so focused

92
00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:24.640
on your short little attention span,

93
00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:25.780
that's all you're gonna get for now.

94
00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.860
You wanna learn more?

95
00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:28.160
I've got another platform you can

96
00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.940
go to check me out.

97
00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:30.800
In the meantime, you're just gonna

98
00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:31.160
have to watch

99
00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:32.960
another video if you're gonna wanna see

100
00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:34.540
how this process plays out.
