If you want the text version of

2
00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:03.720
this, you can go to my blog

3
00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:05.620
at blog.markizano.net.

4
00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:08.400
There I've got the instructions on

5
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.220
a post that I just recently made

6
00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:10.920
on how to connect

7
00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.500
to Wi-Fi in Linux using just

8
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.680
two commands, `wpa_supplicant` and `dhclient`.

9
00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.600
If you're ever in a situation where

10
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.520
your network manager isn't behaving

11
00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.100
or if you want to explore

12
00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:24.720
more about how you connect to a

13
00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.460
Wi-Fi network in Linux without using

14
00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:27.180
a network manager,

15
00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.140
you can use these commands to help

16
00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:31.980
get a better understanding of what

17
00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:32.980
happens under the hood

18
00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:34.940
when it comes to connecting to a

19
00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:35.600
wireless network.

20
00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:37.780
You simply have to make sure that

21
00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:38.900
some packages are installed.

22
00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.140
It does include a couple more steps,

23
00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:42.460
but I think it's worth it for

24
00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:43.180
the control that I

25
00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:44.580
get over being able to connect to

26
00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:44.960
the network.

27
00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:48.420
You can use `wpa_passphrase` to create

28
00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.480
the Wi-Fi key that this client

29
00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.120
will use to perform the

30
00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:53.480
encryption.

31
00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:55.960
Connecting to the wireless network

32
00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:57.460
uses `wpa_supplicant`.

33
00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:59.620
This handles the heavy lifting as

34
00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:01.880
far as encryption and decryption and

35
00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:03.180
talking to the router itself

36
00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.180
so that whenever you're talking to

37
00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:07.560
the wireless router, you don't have

38
00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:08.760
to worry about using

39
00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.460
any keys or doing any kind of encryption.

40
00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:11.400
This does it for you.

41
00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:13.800
And then finally, you'll get the IP

42
00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:15.360
address using dhclient.

43
00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.680
This will allow you to actually communicate

44
00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:19.140
with other devices on the network.

45
00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:21.340
It's interesting because the way Linux

46
00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:23.160
works is you "Do one thing, and

47
00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:23.840
you do it well."

48
00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:25.420
You've got one thing that actually

49
00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:27.080
talks to the Wi-Fi router itself,

50
00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:28.260
and it breaks that

51
00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.300
down separate from getting an IP address

52
00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:32.940
and routing yourself within that network after

53
00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:35.600
the encryption has already been decrypted.

54
00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:37.400
If you have any questions or if

55
00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:39.160
you have any issues, I included some

56
00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:40.100
additional tips that

57
00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:42.560
you should check out in case because,

58
00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:44.940
well, I ran into these problems myself.

59
00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:47.660
And also, I've got some scripts on

60
00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:51.680
Gist GitHub where you can totally

61
00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:52.780
customize this and

62
00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:53.560
make it a service.

63
00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:56.340
If you want to have some fun,

64
00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.480
install it on your system, make sure

65
00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:00.080
those programs are

66
00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:02.180
there installed, and voila, service

67
00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:03.580
start and stop Wi-Fi.

68
00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.920
It'd be awesome.

69
00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:06.160
Let me know what you think in

70
00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:06.600
the comments.

71
00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:07.780
Looking forward to seeing you.

72
00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:08.360
Cheers!
