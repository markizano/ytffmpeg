# Learn How to Learn

I'm going to teach you the secret to how I got so smart, but you're gonna have to stick around to the
end because this isn't something I can just explain in a simple 3 step flashy way that keeps your
eyeballs glued to the screen. To those of you that scrolled away that quickly, I guess you're going
to miss out, but don't come crying to me when you realize you can't figure out why your overnight
Google results aren't making you the six figures you thought they would.

1. Limiting beliefs.
2. Skills.
3. Routine/Process/Plan

## Limiting Beliefs
The number one thing that I see in most people is they have some stupid limiting belief that keeps
them from making the jump or they did jump and just didn't swim when the shit hit the fan and they
ended up in the far side of the lake.
Look, you can swim, stop drowing and just put one hand in front of the other. You'll be surprised
how well you reach the shoreline of your own accord. Either you sit on the couch and complain about
why your bon-bon's are stale or you can get up and bust your ass for that nice filet minon at the
end of the day on a Friday night.

## Skills
Yes, upskilling is always a good idea, but you don't have to pay millions for it, goto a community
college and pay less for your early degrees. Nobody cares where you went so long as you check the box.
If I could tell my younger self to just swallow your pride on this one, it'll save about 90% of my
student loan issues. Also pay for cash. If you don't have it, take a startup job while living with
parents to take advantage of what you need to get your job done.

## Routine / Process / Plan
I see too many people jump into something and have no idea what they are doing and no expectations of
their outcomes or goals and don't write them down or spell it out. If you fail to plan, you plan
to fail.

I develop my process before doing anything. I need to understand the landscape. I need to define my
goals with something or else costs spiral out of control. If I have a specific goal with something,
it makes it much easier to figure out where to go from there and what kind of resources you'll need
to pool together to execute on your desires or what you want to learn.

I also take it upon myself to develop some kind of routine or cadence around it to set the pattern
in my behaviours since I seem to need to do that now instead of just being able to flip a switch
internally to make a change to my habits and behaviours.

# Truths I Have Encountered
- You don't get something for nothing.
- What you put into it is what you get out of it.
- The first anything of its kind will always be the most difficult. The second iteration will be faster.
- No project is ever "complete", you just stop working on it.
