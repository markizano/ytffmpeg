1
00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:06.520
I'm going to give into the negativity

2
00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:07.960
just this one time, just so you

3
00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:08.620
can see the stark

4
00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:10.580
contrast that I sometimes live with...

5
00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:12.260
I can relate to where you come

6
00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:15.320
from when it comes to the 6

7
00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:16.560
years that I put into this

8
00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.620
company that treated me just like

9
00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:21.560
everybody else says on TikTok.

10
00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.500
I mean, corporate America is new age

11
00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.220
slavery America, and as long as we

12
00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.900
can keep you there

13
00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:31.500
working for that paycheck, it's fine,

14
00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.460
we got you... because I put in

15
00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:34.880
6 years worth of work, six and

16
00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:36.220
a half years going on seven.

17
00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:38.180
I was almost ready for my sabbatical.

18
00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:40.340
I completely set up their entire infrastructure.

19
00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:43.660
And I remember talking to one of

20
00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:46.120
the leads who I was there when

21
00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:47.520
the CTO hired her.

22
00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.580
They had since nixed the CTO and

23
00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:51.080
there was plenty of opportunity to

24
00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.800
go ahead and step

25
00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.320
up. Right. Well, I stepped up to

26
00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:54.940
the plate, even though my title was

27
00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:56.420
"SysAdmin", I did

28
00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:57.640
things a director was supposed to

29
00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:57.940
be doing.

30
00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:00.060
I was doing things that a

31
00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:01.280
C-level executive was supposed to be

32
00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:02.660
doing as far as reviewing

33
00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:05.280
financial documents, evaluating SOWs

34
00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.900
and trying to understand the strategy

35
00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:08.580
behind all

36
00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:09.660
the technology and everything that

37
00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:10.300
we were setting up.

38
00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:12.120
And I remember sitting in the conversation

39
00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:14.860
with her and she's like, "Mark," like, "What

40
00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:16.900
can we do to truly show our

41
00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:19.040
appreciation for people like you who've

42
00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:19.840
been with us since

43
00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.080
the start?" And I was like, you

44
00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.580
could give me a title that actually

45
00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:24.420
matches the job role

46
00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.000
that I take. And well, I pretty

47
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.220
much got a non answer to that.

48
00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:30.900
And after leaving the company, you

49
00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.260
know, finding out that they basically

50
00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:32.880
hired someone

51
00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.180
else to take the manager's role that

52
00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:37.200
I had busted my ass off for,

53
00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:38.240
it basically told me

54
00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.160
getting promotion, getting a promotion

55
00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:41.200
was a fscking joke.

56
00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:42.600
I don't know if I'm

57
00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:43.180
too dark.

58
00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:44.640
I don't know if I'm too gay.

59
00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:46.440
I don't know what's

60
00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:47.420
what's wrong with me.

61
00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:48.940
What is wrong with me?

62
00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:50.980
Why am I not good enough for

63
00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:52.820
director level material who's able

64
00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:53.980
to drive the decision

65
00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:56.320
behind how stuff gets done?

66
00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:00.080
On top of that, I spent four

67
00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:02.200
years with my love and tried doing

68
00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:03.040
all the things I could

69
00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:04.740
and that didn't work out.

70
00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:06.780
So I'm sitting here thinking to myself,

71
00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.380
how worthless am I?

72
00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:09.880
How useless am I?

73
00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:11.620
Not good at my job, not good

74
00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:12.320
at personal life.

75
00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:13.580
What the fuck am I doing here?

76
00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:17.380
And I sat in that for months

77
00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:20.540
until I started putting these up to

78
00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:21.960
remind myself I'm not...

79
00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:23.360
Half of them are b/s.

80
00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:24.800
You know, it's like Team-tasticness.

81
00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:26.000
Oh, perfect attendance.

82
00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:26.500
Good job.

83
00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:27.820
But it's something.

84
00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.860
The license.

85
00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:33.540
Yeah, it'd be great because everybody's

86
00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:34.760
like... (that's another lesson to learn.)

87
00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:35.760
Don't listen to what other people

88
00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.200
tell about you because everybody's

89
00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:38.820
like, oh, you'd make

90
00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:40.220
such a great massage therapist.

91
00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:41.220
Guess what?

92
00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:43.860
You would make an even better client.

93
00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:46.080
I still have yet to get people

94
00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.280
on the table like I really need.

95
00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:49.080
And I've started to push myself out

96
00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:50.780
there and say, come on, I need help.

97
00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:52.220
I'm trying to get into a house.

98
00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:53.580
I need people on the table.

99
00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:54.280
Come on, let's go.

100
00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.540
Where are we at?

101
00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:57.800
Nobody crickets, nothing.

102
00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:58.520
Nobody cares.

103
00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.840
Nobody gives a shit.

104
00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:02.640
So it'd be so easy for me

105
00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.400
to just disappear off into the nothingness,

106
00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:05.680
disappear off into

107
00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:09.740
the ether and sign out. May 1st

108
00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:10.180
of this year.

109
00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:11.120
I almost did that.

110
00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:12.620
I started moving money around and

111
00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:13.540
when I did that, that scared the

112
00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:14.140
living daylights out

113
00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.340
of me.

114
00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.760
I was like, holy crap, I cannot

115
00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:18.220
believe I'm actually sitting this

116
00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:18.880
close to the edge.

117
00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:22.380
This brilliance, this mind that has

118
00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:24.960
put so much effort after being told

119
00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:26.200
time and time

120
00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:28.500
again, you are useless, you are worthless,

121
00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:31.220
stupid Mark, fscking Mark, faggot Mark!

122
00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:33.720
So if you wonder why I'm such

123
00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:35.200
a perfectionist, if you wonder why

124
00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:36.240
everything must be so

125
00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:37.540
polished, if you wonder why it's so

126
00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:39.300
difficult to work with me and why

127
00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:41.280
I'm always trying

128
00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.120
to get things right and trying to

129
00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.100
reach everything so that they do the

130
00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:45.540
right things,

131
00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:46.800
it's because of that.

132
00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:48.960
It is a projection of the self.

133
00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:52.100
It is a projection of, I have

134
00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:54.040
never felt like I'm worthy enough.

135
00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:57.200
I have never felt like I was enough.

136
00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:59.400
I always had this voice in my

137
00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:00.700
head constantly pinging at me.

138
00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:01.420
"You should have changed this."

139
00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:02.060
"You should have done that."

140
00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:02.980
"You should have done it this way."

141
00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:03.460
"You should have done it that way."

142
00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:04.620
You know, no, no, no, no, no,

143
00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:04.920
no, no, no.

144
00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:07.520
Years I dealt with that and it

145
00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:09.140
wasn't until the last two years or

146
00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:10.500
so that I finally was

147
00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:12.420
like, fsck all that.

148
00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:13.980
No, we're, we're done.

149
00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:15.540
Just... that's all negative.

150
00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:16.360
That's all hate.

151
00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:17.740
It's all self-deprecation.

152
00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:19.660
Just put it off to the side.

153
00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:23.060
What can we do to love the self?

154
00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.780
And I have been going down this

155
00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:29.320
path in so many ways, shapes and fashions.

156
00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:31.920
I mean, as far as religion is

157
00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:33.160
concerned, I want to read all the books.

158
00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:34.440
As far as philosophy is concerned,

159
00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:36.220
I want to evaluate all the things

160
00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:36.660
that are out there.

161
00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:38.520
As far as theocracy is concerned,

162
00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:39.740
I want to take it as part

163
00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:40.900
of my college courses.

164
00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:42.300
I want to get my minors in

165
00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:42.880
human psychology.

166
00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:45.900
I've got, I mean, it's a matter

167
00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:46.700
of picking a direction.

168
00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:50.000
You've got -- I've got Osash: the Online

169
00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.320
Services Auction, SuperHighway. Angie's list &

170
00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:53.820
eBay basically had a baby.

171
00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:55.420
And instead of it being just housing,

172
00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:56.400
it's everything!

173
00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:57.700
Amazon scale...

174
00:04:58.460 --> 00:04:59.580
Osash is Amazon.

175
00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:02.120
Amazon is products.

176
00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:03.820
Osash is services.

177
00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:05.000
That was an idea.

178
00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:06.120
That was a business idea.

179
00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:07.680
And I had thought through so many

180
00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:09.280
components of it and how I could

181
00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:09.800
string it together.

182
00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:11.520
But fear of success is so real.

183
00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:14.600
Fear of success is very real.

184
00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:15.720
Okay, fine.

185
00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:18.100
I've got the story of Markizano

186
00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:19.940
Draconus who comes from a galaxy 25,000

187
00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:20.520
light years away in

188
00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:21.140
the Crux galaxy.

189
00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:23.420
I have a story that I want

190
00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:25.780
to tell about dreams I've had from

191
00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:26.880
what seems like past lives.

192
00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.660
I don't know... Who knows, but it's

193
00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:29.560
a fun story.

194
00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:33.100
And it's like super sci-fi, fantasy magic,

195
00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:35.080
just space.

196
00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:37.680
It's, it's a glorious story.

197
00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:39.240
If I can sit down and write

198
00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:40.040
it from start to finish.

199
00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:45.140
I can't physically, I'm sitting here

200
00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:46.460
thinking, what can I practically put

201
00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:47.660
my hands on and

202
00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:48.940
get done within a 5-7

203
00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:51.020
period -- 5-7 year period.

204
00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:54.040
And realistically, how can I convince

205
00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:55.960
3 million people to give me $1

206
00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:57.620
at a bare minimum?

207
00:05:58.100 --> 00:05:59.080
That's my retirement.

208
00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:01.440
If I can convince 3 million people

209
00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:03.060
to give me $1, I can live

210
00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:03.620
on the interest.

211
00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:05.780
And I don't have to have crazy

212
00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:06.520
billions or whatever.

213
00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:08.560
And I see absolutely no reason why

214
00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:10.140
we all can't have our 3 million

215
00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:11.040
nest egg.

216
00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:13.020
And we just live off the interest.

217
00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:17.380
What can I practically put my hands on?

218
00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:18.980
I can practically put my hands on

219
00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:19.820
Kizano's Massage.

220
00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:21.760
I can practically put my hands on

221
00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:23.080
the Markizano Draconus story.

222
00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:25.200
I can practically put my hands on

223
00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:27.040
Kizano's Fintech, where you can come,

224
00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:27.740
lab, learn,

225
00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:28.640
grow, evolve.

226
00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:30.200
And I can become a honeypot for

227
00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:31.820
the companies that are trying to hire talent.

228
00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:33.860
Talent can come in and they can

229
00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:35.760
learn to do the things to get

230
00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:36.400
better at whatever they're

231
00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:37.940
doing as far as IT is concerned.

232
00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:41.120
And I get in between that handshake

233
00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:41.580
right there.

234
00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:43.880
As a Libra, I can,

235
00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:44.680
manage commerce.

236
00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:46.320
That's a good place for me.

237
00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:49.080
I know we don't get to choose

238
00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:52.300
our own endings, but Warren Buffett

239
00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:52.960
said it best.

240
00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:54.920
Start with your obituary and work

241
00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:55.480
your way backwards.

242
00:06:56.580 --> 00:06:57.800
What do you want people to say

243
00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:00.120
about you whenever you've already passed?

244
00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:03.080
And you've already got a mind thinking

245
00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:03.860
in that direction.

246
00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:06.620
I think that's extremely admirable.

247
00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:10.300
Because it suggests: what can I do

248
00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:11.740
with all this energy that has been

249
00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:12.340
given to me?

250
00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:14.720
How can I use it the most efficiently?

251
00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:17.340
Such that when my life is fully

252
00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:20.320
consumed, my job here is also done.

253
00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:23.900
Because I Refuse to be a corporate

254
00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:25.460
slave for the rest of my life.

255
00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:28.140
I Refuse to give in to this

256
00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:30.080
idea that I should just make my

257
00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:31.420
life beautiful, pretty, and comfortable

258
00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:33.460
for me and screw everybody else who

259
00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:33.800
ain't me.

260
00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:37.080
I Refuse to accept that mentality

261
00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:38.440
of "it's not enough that I should

262
00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:39.620
win, but you should also lose."

263
00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:43.660
I violently refuse these things.

264
00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:46.140
Because it's just not me.

265
00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:49.340
I'm the kind of person where once

266
00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:51.860
I evolve, grow, do better, and am

267
00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:52.620
able to provide...

268
00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:56.040
That I don't do these things for

269
00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:57.160
me, I do these things for you.

270
00:07:57.240 --> 00:07:58.340
Because after I'm gone, you can't

271
00:07:58.340 --> 00:07:59.040
take the money with you, honey.

272
00:07:59.460 --> 00:08:01.980
I'm sorry; not sorry. But you can't

273
00:08:01.980 --> 00:08:02.420
take it with you.

274
00:08:03.660 --> 00:08:04.840
So, what are you going to do

275
00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:05.460
while you're here?

276
00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:06.700
And what are you going to do

277
00:08:06.700 --> 00:08:07.480
that's going to be meaningful?

278
00:08:08.580 --> 00:08:10.160
What are you going to do that

279
00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:12.140
people are going to actually care about?

280
00:08:13.300 --> 00:08:14.560
Because right now, I'm a nobody.

281
00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:16.120
Nobody knows me.

282
00:08:16.540 --> 00:08:17.500
Nobody gives a sh!t about me.

283
00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:19.240
I could disappear the next day and

284
00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:19.800
y'all just be like,

285
00:08:19.860 --> 00:08:23.480
well, there goes that Markiz guy,

286
00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:24.760
whoever that was, I don't know.

287
00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:26.900
Think about it.

288
00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:28.760
I probably have two or three people

289
00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:29.880
that would really cry.

290
00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:31.760
You know, they might actually shed

291
00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:32.060
a tear.

292
00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:34.920
But outside of that, nobody knows

293
00:08:34.920 --> 00:08:35.380
who I am.

294
00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:36.720
I'm a nobody.

295
00:08:37.660 --> 00:08:38.780
Why should I care what you think?

296
00:08:42.300 --> 00:08:43.260
It's because I do care.

297
00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:44.480
And I care too much.

298
00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:45.620
And if I get to choose my

299
00:08:45.620 --> 00:08:47.420
end, I would like my death for

300
00:08:47.420 --> 00:08:48.540
my 125th birthday.

301
00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:49.480
#plxKThxBai.

302
00:08:49.620 --> 00:08:50.120
Y'all are going to have to

303
00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:50.560
figure it out.

304
00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:51.440
I don't know what the deal is.

305
00:08:51.820 --> 00:08:52.620
I know some of y'all love me.

306
00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:53.640
I know you want me around forever.

307
00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:57.160
But for 125, please, can I please

308
00:08:57.160 --> 00:08:58.400
be done with this life, this plane,

309
00:08:58.500 --> 00:08:59.000
this existence?

310
00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:02.240
And while I'm here, let's turn this

311
00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:03.040
nightmare around.

312
00:09:03.540 --> 00:09:04.780
I'm tired of hearing all the pain

313
00:09:04.780 --> 00:09:05.580
and the sorrow and the hurt.

314
00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:06.400
And oh my God, I'm not enough.

315
00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:06.840
I don't love me.

316
00:09:06.860 --> 00:09:07.260
I don't love me.

317
00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:09.180
Come on, let's go.

318
00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:11.700
If I'm stuck here and I'm stuck

319
00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:13.760
with you, then we got to make

320
00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:14.100
it something.

321
00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:16.940
We have got to pick this up.

322
00:09:19.060 --> 00:09:21.000
And 0xvmx, I applaud you.

323
00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:22.720
I mean, you're doing the thing.

324
00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:23.680
I know you feel like you don't

325
00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:24.820
know what you're doing, but you're

326
00:09:24.820 --> 00:09:25.360
doing something.

327
00:09:26.060 --> 00:09:27.040
And I appreciate it.

328
00:09:27.340 --> 00:09:27.840
Thank you.
