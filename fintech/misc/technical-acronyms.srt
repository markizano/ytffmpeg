1
00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:04.720
So let's talk about technical acronyms.

2
00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:07.900
Let's see if you can name how

3
00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:08.280
many of

4
00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.220
these acronyms mean what they mean.

5
00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:14.948
USB: Think you know this one?

6
00:00:16.183 --> 00:00:18.385
Universal Serial Bus.

7
00:00:19.553 --> 00:00:22.856
Seems like Apple just recently picked up on the "universal" aspect of that...

8
00:00:24.124 --> 00:00:25.826
TCP and UDP:

9
00:00:26.293 --> 00:00:27.583
Think you know what these ones mean?

10
00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.029
Drop a comment below if you do.

11
00:00:30.364 --> 00:00:32.299
Transport* Control Protocol

12
00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:34.601
and User Datagram Protocol.

13
00:00:35.302 --> 00:00:37.104
I bet you hear that all the time and you're like...

14
00:00:37.137 --> 00:00:37.871
"What does that mean???"

15
00:00:38.832 --> 00:00:40.607
How about HTTP?

16
00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:42.409
I know you know this one, right?

17
00:00:43.176 --> 00:00:46.513
It stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol.

18
00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:48.615
This is the rules by which we

19
00:00:48.648 --> 00:00:52.219
transmit information over HTTP.

20
00:00:52.233 --> 00:00:52.234
 

21
00:00:53.387 --> 00:00:55.589
Oh yeah, and the "S" means secure.

22
00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:59.960
What about HTML and CSS?

23
00:00:59.993 --> 00:01:00.794
I mean...

24
00:01:01.028 --> 00:01:02.429
those things like make a web page,

25
00:01:02.462 --> 00:01:02.930
but like

26
00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:03.970
what do they mean?

27
00:01:05.032 --> 00:01:08.468
HTML is just plain text that has been

28
00:01:09.236 --> 00:01:11.104
hypertext markup language.

29
00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:12.606
Which is basically,

30
00:01:12.678 --> 00:01:14.207
text that's kind of sort of been dressed up

31
00:01:14.575 --> 00:01:15.976
with a few tags here and there

32
00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:18.600
that make it a little bit more structured.

33
00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:18.979
They give it

34
00:01:19.012 --> 00:01:20.380
something it can stand on.

35
00:01:20.914 --> 00:01:24.084
Cascading Style Sheets are the descriptions

36
00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:25.886
that you can associate with HTML

37
00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:27.521
in order to represent

38
00:01:27.888 --> 00:01:28.822
how you want it to look.

39
00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.123
Make it look pretty.

40
00:01:31.258 --> 00:01:34.220
Hmm, this one should be an easy one, right?

41
00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:35.963
HDD?

42
00:01:37.264 --> 00:01:39.066
You know it was hard disk drive, right?

43
00:01:40.601 --> 00:01:43.737
Okay, so we hear about IP addresses all the time,

44
00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:45.639
but like... what are they?

45
00:01:46.607 --> 00:01:49.202
Did you know they were Internet Protocol addresses?

46
00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:52.412
Teeing off of HDD,

47
00:01:52.846 --> 00:01:54.481
can you guess what SSD is?

48
00:01:55.449 --> 00:01:57.417
That's your solid state drive.

49
00:01:57.751 --> 00:02:01.088
They're typically faster than your hard disk drives,

50
00:02:01.121 --> 00:02:02.589
because, well...

51
00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:04.858
the storage mechanisms are different.

52
00:02:06.512 --> 00:02:07.961
Continuing down that line,

53
00:02:07.995 --> 00:02:10.631
you've got to know what NVMe stands for, right?

54
00:02:11.208 --> 00:02:12.799
If you did, you're better than me.

55
00:02:12.833 --> 00:02:13.800
I had to look this one up.

56
00:02:14.801 --> 00:02:17.371
It stands for Non-Volatile Memory Express,

57
00:02:17.404 --> 00:02:21.808
and this is why your hard drives are ridiculously fast.

58
00:02:22.175 --> 00:02:22.809
I mean, like close to

59
00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:22.811
 

60
00:02:23.043 --> 00:02:24.344
gigabyte read and write speeds.

61
00:02:24.478 --> 00:02:26.213
It's awesome, if you have gotten one.

62
00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:30.150
If you enjoyed that, I got a lot more.
