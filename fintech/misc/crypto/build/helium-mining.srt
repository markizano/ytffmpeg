1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.460
So let's talk about Helium mining.

2
00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:05.220
What is Helium mining?

3
00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:05.520
Well, it's when you

4
00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:07.580
mine over the Wi-Fi's. It was

5
00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:09.240
a really fascinating concept when

6
00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:09.740
I first got

7
00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:13.020
into it and during the 2017 -- (oops)

8
00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:17.260
2020-2021 bull run I was getting into

9
00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.080
cryptocurrencies and Helium mining

10
00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.980
and piqued my interest because it

11
00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:22.620
was a way

12
00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:25.240
for you to do crypto mining using

13
00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:28.200
radio wave technology compared to conventional

14
00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:30.380
crypto mining where it relies on powerful

15
00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:31.860
gear like ASICs (which are

16
00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:33.880
Application Specific Integrated Circuits)

17
00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:36.620
or GPUs (which are Graphical Processing

18
00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:40.580
Units; aka your video card). Traditional

19
00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:42.300
crypto mining might use those but

20
00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:42.740
as a

21
00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:44.840
result this was a lot less power

22
00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:47.580
intensive and also something that allowed

23
00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.460
Internet of Things (IOT) devices to be able

24
00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:53.100
to chat and talk with each other.

25
00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:54.640
The idea

26
00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:57.780
behind Helium mining was decentralized

27
00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.320
access to the network. You'd plug

28
00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:00.540
it into

29
00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:01.920
the wall you plug it into your

30
00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.760
internet and off to the races you

31
00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:06.400
went. What

32
00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.580
happens is you know those dog collers

33
00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.100
that tell you where your dog is

34
00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.520
even if

35
00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:12.280
it isn't connected to Wi-Fi or

36
00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:15.700
those way old-fashioned GPS's that

37
00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:16.080
are dedicated

38
00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.840
to just knowing your geolocation and

39
00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:19.800
whatever? It wasn't limited to just

40
00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:21.420
geolocation there were packets of

41
00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:22.960
other information like statistics

42
00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:23.520
about what

43
00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:24.820
this particular device was doing,

44
00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.080
Apple watches, smart watches, other

45
00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:28.020
Internet of

46
00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.740
Things devices that needed to connect

47
00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:32.040
to the Internet but didn't need to

48
00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.940
transmit that much information also

49
00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:36.200
did not require a Wi-Fi network.

50
00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:37.520
Well Helium

51
00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:39.260
mining could be a solution that would

52
00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.940
solve that problem and it was a great

53
00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:45.480
solution for low latency low bandwidth

54
00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:47.000
because it required little power

55
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.960
probably $5 of electricity cost per

56
00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:53.840
month and the trackers would come

57
00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:55.760
packed with their own HNT tokens that

58
00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:57.220
would be used to transmit packets of

59
00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:00.480
information and then the miner itself

60
00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:02.020
would be able to communicate and relay

61
00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:03.500
that on the network so that the

62
00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:04.600
rest of the system would be able

63
00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:05.440
to keep track

64
00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:07.300
and keep check on what's going on.

65
00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.280
Because we're using radio signals we'd

66
00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:11.040
be able to tell very clearly specifically

67
00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:13.060
where your device is as far

68
00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:14.540
as elevation placement and all that

69
00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:16.760
other fun stuff is concerned and how far

70
00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.600
away it was from other Helium miners.

71
00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.900
The more packed in a specific area you

72
00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.840
were with other Helium miners the

73
00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.160
more those rewards were being distributed and

74
00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.220
being split. So if you were the

75
00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:30.100
only person inside of a hex grid

76
00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.760
that covered

77
00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:32.140
the whole that you know they basically

78
00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:36.140
gridded the whole planet and if you were

79
00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:37.700
the only miner you were collecting

80
00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:39.620
all the rewards. If you were sharing

81
00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.920
it with

82
00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:41.540
other miners you were splitting the

83
00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:43.760
rewards with them. Anytime a device

84
00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:45.360
needed to connect and talk to any

85
00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:46.880
one of the antennas it would be

86
00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:47.480
sending HNT

87
00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.780
tokens. The miner that received the

88
00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:51.680
communication would receive the HNT

89
00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.640
tokens as a reward of the communication

90
00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:56.580
with the device. If you were a

91
00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:57.340
witness to

92
00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:59.300
the communication then you would get

93
00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:01.940
witness tokens. Once that information was

94
00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:03.480
sent back to the servers they'd be

95
00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.100
recorded to the blockchain where the

96
00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:06.580
validators would be able to take that

97
00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:08.240
information and verify everything

98
00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:10.540
matched up correctly. The validator

99
00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:13.040
role was oftentimes placed in different

100
00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:15.800
was randomly selected by one of the

101
00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:17.480
miners. So in a way you were

102
00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:17.940
playing the

103
00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:19.460
lottery every time you interacted

104
00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:20.800
with one of these devices because

105
00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:21.420
you may be

106
00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:22.980
elected to be one of the validators.

107
00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:26.440
I follow VoskCoin on the other platform

108
00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:28.240
and he was talking about how he

109
00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:30.700
made like $5,000 in HNT tokens

110
00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:31.600
from being one

111
00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:33.220
of the validators that validated the

112
00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:36.260
transactions. Well that sense has been

113
00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.360
changed. The validators are now a

114
00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:40.540
specific server setup that Helium, the

115
00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:42.420
developers, control and you have to

116
00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:44.120
be part of the whitelist in order

117
00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:44.480
for them

118
00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:45.960
to be able to permit you to

119
00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:46.980
be one of the servers that do

120
00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:48.760
the validation. So I

121
00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:50.280
don't like how the reward structure

122
00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:52.580
has changed as a result because it

123
00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:53.000
felt like

124
00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.300
HNT was very token heavy and that

125
00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:57.960
it was very rewards based. But putting

126
00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:58.240
that to

127
00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:00.180
the side, you used to be able

128
00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:01.980
to build your own miner. You would

129
00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:02.620
be able to take

130
00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:04.000
the antennas, hook them up to your

131
00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.460
own computer, build the software and then

132
00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:08.300
you're off to the races. You're now

133
00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:10.280
part of the Helium network transmitting data

134
00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:12.600
and you can control it yourself. This

135
00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:13.860
proved to be pretty difficult for

136
00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:14.040
a lot

137
00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:17.600
of people so, not sponsored, but Bobcat,

138
00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:21.000
Nebra and MNTD ("Minted") took up the

139
00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.840
helm of providing these pre-built

140
00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:24.540
boxes that came with the software

141
00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:25.360
pre-installed

142
00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:27.240
and with the radio antennas already

143
00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:30.080
connected to them. The ability to

144
00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:30.360
be able

145
00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:31.940
to create the miners yourself kind

146
00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:33.080
of sort of fell away and it

147
00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:33.540
seemed like it

148
00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:34.780
was impossible for me to be able

149
00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:36.320
to just buy a RaspberryPi and

150
00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:37.100
an antenna and

151
00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:39.380
have a nice day. And after it's

152
00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:40.640
all said and done, I paid about

153
00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:42.280
$450 per miner.

154
00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:44.980
Bobcat took about 10 months to deliver

155
00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:46.200
the miner that I had put an

156
00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:46.620
order for

157
00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:48.740
them with. I also tried a few

158
00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:50.380
times to get another miner from MNTD.

159
00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:51.520
It took

160
00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:53.100
them about three weeks to deliver

161
00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:55.040
the Helium miner that I got from

162
00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:57.180
them. So now

163
00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:59.080
I've got two Helium miners. One sitting

164
00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:00.780
in the living room. I figured I'd take

165
00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:02.000
the other one over to a friend's

166
00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.060
house that's been sitting over there

167
00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:03.400
for some

168
00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:06.140
time. And I am probably sitting on

169
00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:08.740
maybe $30 of HNT tokens. I probably

170
00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:09.860
have $8

171
00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:13.680
in IOT tokens. They also migrated

172
00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:16.160
from their own blockchain over to

173
00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:17.460
Solana. So

174
00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:19.260
they're no longer managing their own

175
00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:20.660
thing. They're now taking it over

176
00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:21.000
to a

177
00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.040
new blockchain where now you've got

178
00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:25.540
the IOT token, the mobile token and

179
00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:25.800
a few

180
00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:27.600
other things that I guess they were

181
00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:29.940
not able to put into their own blockchain

182
00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:36.460
so quickly. They also started offering

183
00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:40.280
a 5G alternative that you could put

184
00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:42.280
inside of your house as well. You

185
00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:44.440
connect this to your connected to

186
00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:44.840
the wall for

187
00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:46.080
power, connect it to the internet

188
00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:47.920
so it had access to it. And

189
00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:49.080
the 5G device would

190
00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:51.360
be able to provide 5G internet to

191
00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:52.900
all your devices that were in that

192
00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:53.840
area. And

193
00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:55.220
the same rules applied as far as

194
00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:57.460
being able to communicate. Just a

195
00:05:57.460 --> 00:05:57.680
little bit

196
00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:59.260
different because 5G has a lot more

197
00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:01.140
bandwidth than the low-frequency

198
00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:06.500
LoRaWAN. I can't remember exactly

199
00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:08.900
what that was. But it was the

200
00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:12.340
low-frequency, low-latency antennas

201
00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:14.120
that talked to the other devices.

202
00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:17.120
My take on

203
00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:18.860
this was that Helium was a great

204
00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:21.040
concept because decentralizing the

205
00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:22.140
internet was

206
00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:24.860
just... why? We all have Wi-Fi

207
00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:26.400
routers. Why do we need to talk

208
00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:27.020
to a central

209
00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:28.700
authority to communicate with the

210
00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:30.580
internet when I could just bounce

211
00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:30.920
off of

212
00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:32.100
Wi-Fi routers to get to the

213
00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:35.520
internet and we decentralize it rather

214
00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:36.060
than keep it

215
00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:37.900
centralized? It sounded like a great

216
00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:39.980
concept. I didn't like how it was

217
00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:40.340
on just

218
00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:42.400
those IOT devices and it was great

219
00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:44.120
that they were trying to support 5G.

220
00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:45.160
What I

221
00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:46.560
would have loved to have seen was

222
00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:49.480
more Wi-Fi general-purpose use with the

223
00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:51.860
internet. Seeing as that didn't take

224
00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:54.180
place, things have been shifted around.

225
00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:56.400
The reward structure has been moved

226
00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:58.700
so that you don't get that, you

227
00:06:58.700 --> 00:06:58.980
know, you

228
00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:00.820
don't get any of those lottery winnings

229
00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:02.600
that came from being a validator on the

230
00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:04.380
network. You now have to pay for

231
00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:07.300
incredible hardware and also software

232
00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:09.300
and possibly even a membership fee.

233
00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:11.120
I don't know but possibly even a

234
00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:14.260
membership fee to be a validator on

235
00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:19.200
the Helium network. I don't like the fact

236
00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:22.280
that now the the workers are not

237
00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:24.320
getting, are hardly getting any of the

238
00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:27.480
rewards because, you know, it's just

239
00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:30.620
sad that I paid $450 for this

240
00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:31.860
piece of hardware that was supposed

241
00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:33.440
to make its returns within a month

242
00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:33.820
or two

243
00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:36.120
which was completely unbelievable

244
00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:39.020
and unrealistic. But hey, you know, if

245
00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:40.060
you got in early you got in

246
00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:42.320
great but if not now the miners

247
00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:43.380
are selling for about

248
00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:45.860
$100 on the second-hand market and

249
00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:47.600
$200 if you can find it

250
00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:50.340
fresh. But even then it's difficult

251
00:07:50.340 --> 00:07:51.740
to buy it off the second-hand market

252
00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:53.120
because there are certain keys and

253
00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:54.640
tokens that are embedded in the device

254
00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:57.360
itself that need to be given to

255
00:07:57.360 --> 00:07:59.000
you so you have to trust the

256
00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:00.000
seller. They are

257
00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:01.320
also going to give you the keys

258
00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:04.000
to that, the software keys to that

259
00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:05.080
miner so that

260
00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:07.060
you can receive the rewards not mining

261
00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:11.420
for them. Boy, that was fun.

262
00:08:11.420 --> 00:08:11.880
So yeah, my

263
00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:13.540
take on Helium mining was that it

264
00:08:13.540 --> 00:08:18.020
was a great idea but a terrible implementation

265
00:08:18.020 --> 00:08:21.600
not to mention Nebra, MNTD, and

266
00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:23.200
Bobcat did not do a good job

267
00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:23.400
at the

268
00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:24.920
manufacturing. Bobcat was the best

269
00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:26.440
for the longest but I waited the

270
00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:26.880
longest for

271
00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:29.800
my miner from them. Also this is

272
00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:31.860
a requisite video to a comment reply that

273
00:08:31.860 --> 00:08:33.960
I'm gonna be making on Althera which

274
00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:38.500
is, looks like, the promising prospect of

275
00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:42.380
what I wished Helium could be.

276
00:08:42.380 --> 00:08:43.600
So that's next.
