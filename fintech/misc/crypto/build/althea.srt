1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
So my thoughts on Althea L1, it

2
00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:06.320
looks like it's trying to be a

3
00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:08.040
cryptocurrency based

4
00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:11.380
Infrastructure kind of sort of like

5
00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:13.200
helium was if you don't know about

6
00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.780
helium, you've never heard of that before

7
00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:16.540
I just created a video you should

8
00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:17.580
go check that out first

9
00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.460
Because it'll give you some insights

10
00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:20.900
and some context around this because

11
00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:22.080
I don't like talking about stuff

12
00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.200
But I've never talked about before

13
00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.280
so I gave you a spiel on

14
00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:27.720
helium and my take on Althea

15
00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.420
It looks like the promising aspect

16
00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:31.900
of what I was looking for what

17
00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:34.100
I was looking for in helium by providing

18
00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:37.420
internet access to rural areas where

19
00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:38.700
it's difficult because

20
00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:41.200
Centralized providers just don't draw

21
00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:42.240
lines out that far

22
00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:44.760
And so the idea is if you

23
00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.200
have multiple Wi-Fi devices that can

24
00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:49.700
connect to each other in a decentralized fashion

25
00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:53.080
Then ideally you'd still be able to

26
00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:53.900
connect to the internet

27
00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:55.360
Albeit it may be a little bit slower

28
00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:57.860
But you'd still have a minimal amount

29
00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:59.360
of access to the internet because

30
00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:00.660
it would be completely decentralized

31
00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.560
They're not completely but at least

32
00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:03.580
partially decentralized

33
00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:07.780
Just like helium it looks really promising

34
00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:09.640
it looks really great on the surface

35
00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:11.360
I'm curious to know what it looks

36
00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:12.520
like on the inside because

37
00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:14.340
There are some really great projects

38
00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:15.880
out there and some of them have

39
00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:17.000
really done some good things

40
00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:19.460
I

41
00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:22.320
Caution with this because it's crypto

42
00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.400
based. That's why I'm like, I don't know

43
00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:27.240
Because if you own it and you're

44
00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.880
distributing it who's to say somebody

45
00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:29.840
can't exploit it

46
00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:31.240
Who's to say somebody can't take this

47
00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:32.200
and centralize it again?

48
00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:34.400
Who's to say somebody can't influence

49
00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:35.680
the developers and their decisions

50
00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:36.320
on what to do?

51
00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.640
there was all this talk in crypto

52
00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.120
about how because it's decentralized

53
00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:41.320
it because it's this because

54
00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:43.300
Because it's decentralized because

55
00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:45.420
you know, the community has to agree

56
00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:45.840
to this

57
00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.420
It doesn't take much for somebody

58
00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:48.680
to come through and pay the developers

59
00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:49.940
to go do what they need to do

60
00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:52.780
So keeping that in mind

61
00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.100
It looks like a promising prospect

62
00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:59.480
you are right to sit and wait

63
00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:01.760
you are right to sit there and watch

64
00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:04.280
Because that's what I would do if

65
00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:06.180
it stands the test of time and

66
00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.500
it lasts four years

67
00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:10.100
Then I might be interested in investing.

68
00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:11.840
I might be interested in purchasing.

69
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.660
I might be interested in looking into it

70
00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:16.160
But at this point after being burnt

71
00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.240
from crypto and losing about $40,000

72
00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.280
in various projects in 2021

73
00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:23.960
I'm a lot more conservative now when

74
00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:26.580
it comes to prospects because I don't

75
00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:28.720
know what you're going to do after

76
00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:29.360
you get my money

77
00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:31.360
with that said

78
00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:34.560
This is not financial advice. This

79
00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.480
is not a

80
00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.760
Poo-poo on something. It's just a

81
00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.300
projection of my experiences and

82
00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:45.280
My experience says it's okay to pause

83
00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.500
and wait. It's okay to watch

84
00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.180
Research learn more interview other

85
00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:52.040
people that you might know who are

86
00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:54.260
in this. What's their experience with

87
00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:55.300
it? What are their gripes?

88
00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:58.440
Try and see if

89
00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.200
You know, this looks like something

90
00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.780
that's relatively new. So how much

91
00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:04.180
history does this happen? Actually,

92
00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:05.180
no, it says since 2018

93
00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:06.440
Okay, so they've been through at least

94
00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:08.500
they've been through at least a cycle

95
00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:10.640
or two. So that's good

96
00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:12.840
actually that gives a little bit more

97
00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:14.400
confidence to what they might be trying

98
00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:15.020
to provide and

99
00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:17.100
being that decentralized

100
00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:19.640
Entity or being some kind of decentralized

101
00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:21.520
entity that allows you to be able

102
00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:22.580
to connect

103
00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:23.920
I mean it'd be great if I

104
00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:25.260
could open my Wi-Fi up and

105
00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:26.140
allow other people access

106
00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:28.680
but do that in a secure way

107
00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.300
so that they can't see my communications

108
00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:32.240
as well to be able to grant

109
00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:33.240
somebody access to the

110
00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:35.540
Internet and not have them see the

111
00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:37.060
rest of the internals of my network.

112
00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:39.760
That'd be kind of cool because then

113
00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:41.920
You have a combination of being a

114
00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:44.060
provider and a consumer and to those

115
00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:44.720
that consume it

116
00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:45.980
Yeah, if you can track it and

117
00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:47.120
you know exactly what they're consuming.

118
00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:48.400
It'd be easy to go ahead and

119
00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:49.560
build them exactly what they're using

120
00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:52.460
So if they can pull it off

121
00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:54.820
if if they do it great if

122
00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:55.560
they do a good job

123
00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:57.500
if the developers are on point and

124
00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:59.760
if they're able to accomplish their

125
00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:00.940
goals then

126
00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:04.460
By all means I want one too

127
00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:06.680
and

128
00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:09.800
I'll tag citizen fortress in this

129
00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:11.080
as well. Perhaps he can help you

130
00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:13.640
out in researching this as well because he's

131
00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:17.640
I'm not sure but I think he

132
00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:19.940
might be trying to explore alternative

133
00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:23.820
internet solutions. So we'll see what happens
