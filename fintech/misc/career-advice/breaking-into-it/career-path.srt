1
00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.840
So, let's talk about your career path.

2
00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.680
Now, this is more directive rather than

3
00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:07.400
prescriptive. So, take this with a

4
00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:08.880
grain of salt. It's not a

5
00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:09.480
one-size-fits-all

6
00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:10.780
kind of thing. It's just a general

7
00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:12.820
pattern that I've seen in the industry.

8
00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:15.400
If you're new to IT, you typically

9
00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:16.820
are going to go down one of three

10
00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:18.280
different routes. Either you're going

11
00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:19.560
to be social, you're going to be

12
00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:20.240
design heavy,

13
00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:21.440
or you're going to be functional.

14
00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:24.740
I chose functional. Let me expand

15
00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:25.360
on that just a

16
00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:27.020
little bit further here. If you're

17
00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:28.760
going down the social path, that's typically

18
00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:29.980
going to be your business analyst,

19
00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:32.660
your release manager, your project manager,

20
00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.800
maybe even middle management. Social,

21
00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.000
I tend to think of it as

22
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:36.600
like people

23
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.060
management or peopling because you

24
00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:40.360
like to deal with people. Your helpdesk --

25
00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.100
(let me hold on, pause before I

26
00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:44.440
get there.) Your designs are going

27
00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:45.220
to be more like

28
00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:46.640
your Photoshop, your Illustrator,

29
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.480
your Adobe products. If you're getting into

30
00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.100
gaming, that could be a thing too,

31
00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:51.680
(but I have also learned from experience that

32
00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.060
gaming can also be very function heavy

33
00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:56.300
too with the whole geometry, graphics, and

34
00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.360
trying to understand how to draw pixels

35
00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:00.620
on the screen.) But there's also the user

36
00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:03.520
experience or UX. Some people also

37
00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:05.040
call this MX, which is like the membership

38
00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.980
experience. The idea is to have flows

39
00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:10.200
and designs that actually work and cohesive.

40
00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.420
You know, first name, last name, email

41
00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.200
address, password. What order do those go

42
00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:16.760
in? How is this supposed to look?

43
00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:18.480
It's supposed to ease and flow this

44
00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:18.900
way to

45
00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.420
make it simple to navigate and to

46
00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:23.080
just intuitively figure things out. Designs

47
00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:25.440
are good at that. Function is going

48
00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:27.200
to be your DevOps, your cloud ops, your

49
00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:28.900
information security, your operation

50
00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:31.280
security, programming, things that deal

51
00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.480
with the actual way things work, the

52
00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:36.660
function of it. Is it aesthetic? Is

53
00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:37.740
it not

54
00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.320
only aesthetic? Does it meet the business

55
00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.660
requirements and does the function match

56
00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:44.960
with the social such that the things

57
00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.140
do what they're supposed to do? And the

58
00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:49.040
three of these together are all part

59
00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.240
of a team. So there's somebody who's

60
00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:51.380
going to

61
00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:52.740
be dealing with the people, somebody

62
00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.140
who's going to be making it look pretty,

63
00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:55.840
and somebody who's going to be helping

64
00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:57.900
to make it work. If you can

65
00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:58.400
find somebody

66
00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:00.680
who can do all three, they're unicorns.

67
00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:03.320
You're a rarity. But most people

68
00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:04.980
specialize in something. And if one

69
00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:09.180
of these is calling to you, then certain

70
00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:11.180
types and jobs that you are going

71
00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:12.580
to want to apply for, that are

72
00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:13.080
going to get

73
00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:14.400
you to the places where you want

74
00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.040
to go, and hopefully these give you enough

75
00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.420
exposure so that you can glean off

76
00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:21.520
of what people are doing related to these

77
00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:23.120
fields, related to these areas, getting

78
00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:24.360
these jobs. If you get a help

79
00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:25.520
desk job, if

80
00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:27.680
you get a reception job. When I

81
00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.160
say receptionist, I mean there's somebody

82
00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:30.260
that works in the front off in

83
00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.240
the office, like when people go and actually

84
00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:33.460
work in the office, and you notice

85
00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:34.600
there's always somebody there to like

86
00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:36.580
greet the guests, let them come in,

87
00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:37.860
show them around, make sure to get their

88
00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:39.580
badges, make sure their security is

89
00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:40.620
in check, and all that fun stuff.

90
00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.580
You know,

91
00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:43.400
having this job can expose you to

92
00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.400
various things. Having help desk can

93
00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:46.080
expose you

94
00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.360
to being able to work with people,

95
00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.520
so that you can evolve into project

96
00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:50.960
management, release management, and

97
00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:53.040
get into those upper, I would say,

98
00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:55.580
just past

99
00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:57.440
entry-level jobs that are like just

100
00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:00.560
a slight upgrade from this. If you're a

101
00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:02.280
function guy, you're gonna want to

102
00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.020
get into data entry jobs, working

103
00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.560
with Excel,

104
00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:07.140
working with CSV files. If you're

105
00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:08.340
savvy enough and you want to try

106
00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:08.960
your hand at

107
00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:10.360
some things, you can get into API

108
00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:12.600
development itself. You can get into being

109
00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:14.280
a web dev. I highly recommend the

110
00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.580
Linux Plus certification, and whatever

111
00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:17.040
it takes

112
00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:18.980
to get to understand and know Linux

113
00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:21.320
better. If you know it inside and

114
00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:21.840
out, I

115
00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.800
promise you, function people, you

116
00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:27.120
are going to succeed very well if you

117
00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.360
learn how to use Linux. I'm not

118
00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:31.260
gonna speak about things I don't know, because

119
00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.320
I avoided design like a plague during

120
00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:35.700
my early years, because I tried and

121
00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:35.900
I was

122
00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:36.620
just like, I'm not good at that.

123
00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:37.460
I know I'm not good at that,

124
00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:38.480
and I'm not gonna

125
00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:40.060
put the efforts in it just yet,

126
00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:42.380
trying to figure it out. So unfortunately,

127
00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:42.820
I kind

128
00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:44.720
of pigeonholed myself into a place

129
00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:46.300
where I don't know the design space

130
00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:46.760
as well as

131
00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:48.860
I should or could; so if you could

132
00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:49.940
drop a comment below and you know

133
00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:50.300
something I

134
00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:52.560
don't, I would appreciate that. And

135
00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:53.860
then finally, we'll close this up

136
00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:54.280
with some

137
00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:55.500
points that you're gonna want to take

138
00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:56.760
home. Don't let this be the end

139
00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:56.980
of this

140
00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:58.700
conversation, and don't let this be

141
00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:00.040
the one video you watch and say,

142
00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:01.960
oh I tried. If

143
00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:03.180
there's one thing about IT and there's

144
00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:05.060
one thing I learned, persistence is key.

145
00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:07.480
Consistency is key, and if you have

146
00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:09.400
a passion for it, it works all

147
00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:09.980
the more to

148
00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:11.520
your favor. You want to make sure

149
00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:13.240
that your resume is on point. You

150
00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:13.560
want to make

151
00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:16.580
sure that it's got all the details

152
00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:18.240
that are needed to be able to

153
00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:18.900
contact with

154
00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:20.360
you at the header, at the top,

155
00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:22.540
need to be visible. You get one

156
00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:23.480
of three things. You

157
00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:25.460
either get to emphasize your experience,

158
00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:28.840
your skills, or your education. Whatever

159
00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:30.860
you value most goes at the top,

160
00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:34.900
and sort in that order. And at

161
00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:35.600
least that's how I

162
00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:38.440
set up my resumes. I also kind

163
00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:39.340
of sort out how I notice about

164
00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:39.960
people whenever I

165
00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:41.940
look at their resumes. Schedule interviews.

166
00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:43.820
Be the active one. Be the one

167
00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:45.280
that is putting yourself on people's

168
00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:48.580
calendars. Follow up. Get on them. Make

169
00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:49.720
sure that they know that you're here.

170
00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:51.720
Make sure that they know that you are

171
00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:53.480
ready and available for work, that

172
00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:55.420
you're excited, that you want to know

173
00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:56.340
about any

174
00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:57.740
of the opportunities that possibly

175
00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:59.780
could be to help you get going,

176
00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:00.920
because you

177
00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:03.320
want to work. In this economy, in

178
00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:04.840
this current state where we're,

179
00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:06.120
we're tipping on the verge of recession

180
00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:07.980
and the tight monetary policy and

181
00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:09.200
everything, people are kind of scared.

182
00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:10.100
I don't know if they want to spend

183
00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:11.680
their money. Guess what? That's when

184
00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:12.580
you step in the door and you

185
00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:14.120
say, look, I may

186
00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:15.540
I know everything up in here, but

187
00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:17.940
I'm willing to learn what I need to

188
00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:20.300
learn. And as someone who is new

189
00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:21.760
to this, I come with a fresh

190
00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:23.800
perspective, and I'm

191
00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:25.420
also willing to do what it takes

192
00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:27.320
to get the job done. And I'm

193
00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:27.820
willing to make

194
00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:29.560
myself available in order to make

195
00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:31.040
this happen. And for the duration

196
00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:31.520
of time that

197
00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:32.880
I'm here, I'm gonna make

198
00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:33.800
sure that I do a good job.

199
00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:35.080
Find others and

200
00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:36.780
continue to network with wherever

201
00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:38.700
you happen to be. So if you

202
00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:39.600
are trying to get

203
00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:41.260
into the programming space, go find

204
00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:43.260
the programming chats. IRC is where you're

205
00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:44.700
gonna find a bunch of them libera.chat

206
00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:46.320
Not sponsored, but...

207
00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:47.180
I hang out

208
00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:49.860
there too as Markizano. You also,

209
00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:51.940
you know, people who go and file

210
00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:53.240
resumes on

211
00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:54.620
LinkedIn and like just leave it at

212
00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:56.340
that. There's a reason why they're

213
00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:56.640
not getting

214
00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:59.020
a job. Follow up. Find people that

215
00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:00.760
work there. Bug them. Be like, hey,

216
00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:01.040
I've been

217
00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:02.020
looking at your company. I'm talking

218
00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:03.160
with HR. I was wondering if you

219
00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:03.500
could help me

220
00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:04.880
out because like I'm wondering what

221
00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:05.980
you guys are working on. You know,

222
00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:06.160
I don't

223
00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:06.980
want to be too creepy and all

224
00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:08.320
that, but like I really would love

225
00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:08.780
to work here.

226
00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:10.320
I'm passionate about what you guys

227
00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:11.920
got going on, and I want to

228
00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:12.660
help you guys out.

229
00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:15.420
And I've wanted to take that strategy.

230
00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:19.440
I've wanted to explore the concept of

231
00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:22.340
what if you get on the good

232
00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:24.360
graces of the team rather than going

233
00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:25.820
through the front door. You go and

234
00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:26.800
you talk to the team, and you

235
00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:27.100
get on their

236
00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:28.720
good rapport, and now the team's talking

237
00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:33.000
to HR. You're talking to HR...

238
00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:35.280
I don't know for certain.

239
00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:36.720
That's not a tried-and-true, but

240
00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:37.220
I'm curious.

241
00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:38.140
Would you be willing to try it

242
00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:38.940
out and find out? And let me

243
00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:39.320
know in the comments (I heard this from Alex Hormozi)

244
00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:42.060
below. I'd be curious to know. And

245
00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:43.160
the last thing I would leave you

246
00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:43.680
with is

247
00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:44.760
don't turn your brain off at night.

248
00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:46.360
If you have time on your hands,

249
00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:47.060
you have time

250
00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:49.600
to read. Go to W3schools.com. Find

251
00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:52.500
anything and everything you can about the

252
00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:53.900
technologies you want to get into.

253
00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:55.200
See if you can find yourself a

254
00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:56.300
home lab. See if

255
00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:58.120
you can find online free resources

256
00:06:58.120 --> 00:06:59.500
that let you set up a terminal,

257
00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:00.240
a console, a

258
00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:01.940
server. Run on the free tier on

259
00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:03.760
AWS... something to give you some

260
00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:04.800
experience so

261
00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:05.940
that you can actually go do the

262
00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:08.420
things. Because there is no better

263
00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:09.280
way to learn

264
00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:10.240
how to do this stuff than to

265
00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:11.920
do it. Than to set up your

266
00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:13.340
own prototype.

267
00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:14.280
That was one of the things that

268
00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:15.300
I had to do in order to

269
00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:16.760
learn the four major

270
00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:18.640
softwares out there. Chef, Ansible,

271
00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:22.440
Puppet, and SaltStack. I set up, I

272
00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:23.100
used a test

273
00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:24.880
lab and set up a mock interface

274
00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:27.100
of an instance of what all of those

275
00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:28.780
technologies would look like. How

276
00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:30.120
would it work and function and and

277
00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:31.940
and. It

278
00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:33.300
takes a bit of work. It takes

279
00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:35.240
some tenacity. But IT can be a

280
00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:35.860
lot of fun, a

281
00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:38.280
lot of rewarding. Mentally, emotionally,

282
00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:40.720
financially. You're gonna love it.

283
00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:41.260
Welcome.
