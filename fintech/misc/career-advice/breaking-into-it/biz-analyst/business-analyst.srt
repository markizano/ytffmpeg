1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.680
Why yes, yes we can =)

2
00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:06.600
Let's talk about business analysts. Now the good business

3
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.060
analysts that I've worked with in

4
00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:09.820
the past have been the kind that

5
00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:10.280
are the

6
00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:11.940
ones that interface with engineering

7
00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.280
and QA. They interface with the project

8
00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:15.940
managers and they interface with the

9
00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:18.540
customer. The business analyst's job

10
00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:18.940
is to

11
00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:20.660
go in with the project manager and

12
00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:22.800
with the customer and to understand the

13
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.540
business need. They are the authority

14
00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:26.880
on trying to decipher what it is

15
00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:27.520
the CEO is

16
00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:29.560
talking about. Whenever he says he

17
00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:31.940
needs this product that's got these features

18
00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:33.860
and we want the buttons this way,

19
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.320
we want this that way, the project

20
00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:35.900
manager is

21
00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:37.860
there to help structure the release

22
00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.660
cycle so that the SDLC (Software

23
00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:43.180
Development LifeCycle) processes like

24
00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:45.220
it's supposed to. It is there for

25
00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:46.900
efficiency and to help expedite things

26
00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:48.720
and unblock blockers and such like that.

27
00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:51.460
The project manager is kind of sort

28
00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:53.600
of for the structure of the project itself

29
00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.800
whereas the business analyst is going

30
00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.300
to be the authority on if there are

31
00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:00.040
features or business requirements

32
00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:02.460
that we're working on within a particular

33
00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.820
project. The business analyst is the

34
00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:07.560
authority to go to on the decision if

35
00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:08.840
there's anything that needs to be

36
00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.180
made as far as what direction do

37
00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:11.500
we go.

38
00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:14.440
Do we really want something on the

39
00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:15.620
home page that's going to trigger

40
00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:16.240
a query in

41
00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:19.000
the background for a statistic or

42
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.200
do we want to try and cache

43
00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:20.960
that for later or

44
00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:22.260
save that for later or something like

45
00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:23.860
that you know something somebody has to

46
00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:26.180
click on to initiate an action so

47
00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:28.080
that it doesn't draw the servers down

48
00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:28.500
as such.

49
00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.160
The business analyst is technical

50
00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:32.760
enough to be able to interface with the

51
00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:35.120
engineering team kind of sort of on

52
00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:38.040
a high level. A project manager typically is

53
00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.160
the one who's going to be more

54
00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:41.400
savvy because they interface with the

55
00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:42.840
engineering and the QA teams more

56
00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.560
and the project manager is kind of

57
00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:44.740
sort of

58
00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:45.740
there to kind of sort of tee

59
00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:46.900
off and take care of some things

60
00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:47.820
but the business

61
00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.920
analyst is also that customer relations

62
00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:53.300
style and type of role where

63
00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:54.740
you're going to be making

64
00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:56.400
sure the customer is comfortable and

65
00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:57.280
okay and

66
00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:59.380
happy and that their needs have been

67
00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:01.940
serviced. If we present a product or

68
00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:04.020
some kind of service to them that

69
00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.300
they understand what it does how it can

70
00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:08.680
benefit what happens and also possibly

71
00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:10.580
even facilitate some sales because it's

72
00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:12.580
some kind of a relationship that somebody

73
00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:14.580
has to serve that is that customers

74
00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:17.040
dedicated line to go talk to when

75
00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.360
it comes to updates to a particular software

76
00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:20.600
that you happen to be working for

77
00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:22.280
within a company or an organization.
