1
00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:03.640
So, let's talk about how your computer works.

2
00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:06.940
This is really fascinating because

3
00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:08.960
computers act and behave, or actually,

4
00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:09.880
computers were

5
00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:12.160
made in man's image a lot more

6
00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:13.580
similarly than you'd think.

7
00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:15.680
Let's imagine you have your computer here.

8
00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:17.620
And a lot of people get this wrong.

9
00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:19.120
They, you know, think storage and

10
00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:20.900
memory, it's all the same stuff, right?

11
00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:22.740
No, it's not.

12
00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.020
Storage, what's on disk, is completely

13
00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:28.040
different than what is in memory.

14
00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:30.320
You may have noticed from older sessions

15
00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:32.460
that it is called RAM, which stands

16
00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:33.300
for Random

17
00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.300
Access Memory.

18
00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:36.740
And that's because it's a mess up

19
00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:37.800
here trying to figure out what's going

20
00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:38.520
on inside of this

21
00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:38.720
thing.

22
00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:40.460
You can think of it this way,

23
00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:42.980
storage, this is what is stored for

24
00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:43.600
long term.

25
00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:45.440
This is those memories that you have

26
00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.380
from, you know, winter of last year,

27
00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:48.620
or COVID, or

28
00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:50.560
the last presidential election, or,

29
00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:51.720
you know, some things that it seems

30
00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:52.320
like a lot of people

31
00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.180
seem to be missing is, you know,

32
00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:56.340
the ability to store information and

33
00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:57.340
save it for later.

34
00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:59.900
And be able to recall that information

35
00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:02.220
into your memory banks.

36
00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.020
And this is where you're maybe working

37
00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:06.440
in some finance, you may be working

38
00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.800
with some

39
00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:08.720
numbers, you may be in some Excel

40
00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.660
workbook, and you've got a view of

41
00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:12.320
all these tables

42
00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:14.680
and columns and stuff, a visual representation

43
00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:17.420
of that in your head, in your

44
00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:18.640
memory, in your

45
00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:20.380
RAM, your random access location,

46
00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:22.180
where all that information is stored

47
00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:24.000
in immediate recall,

48
00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:25.420
that frontal part of your brain that

49
00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:27.220
says, okay, I got it, right?

50
00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:27.480
Right there.

51
00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:28.020
Right?

52
00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:30.180
Let's say you switch context.

53
00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:32.540
Let's say you changed apps on your

54
00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:35.360
phone, that app, the state of its

55
00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:36.120
being the fact

56
00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:38.400
that it's been, you know, read off

57
00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.020
the disk, all the configuration has

58
00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:40.960
been read off the

59
00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:42.800
disk, the binary information is now

60
00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:43.720
inside of the memory.

61
00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.860
To write all that information back

62
00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:47.840
to the disk would be extremely expensive.

63
00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:50.020
You see, there's a cost factor here.

64
00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:52.620
RAM is really, really, really, really,

65
00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:53.560
really fast.

66
00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:56.620
Like nanosecond, one, two, three nanoseconds

67
00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:58.900
it takes to read and write information off

68
00:01:58.900 --> 00:01:59.740
of RAM.

69
00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:02.140
The disk, however, can take anywhere

70
00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:03.760
between two, three hundred milliseconds

71
00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:05.160
and more.

72
00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.860
So it's really expensive to take information

73
00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.020
from RAM and transfer it back and

74
00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.380
forth from

75
00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:10.800
the disk.

76
00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.840
So what do we do?

77
00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:14.640
We open up files on the file

78
00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.540
system, or have different places,

79
00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:17.460
different chips, different

80
00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:19.960
spaces where you can cache that information.

81
00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.400
So after the information has been

82
00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.400
read from the disk, processed by the

83
00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:25.480
processor, stored

84
00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.300
within the memory, information can

85
00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.200
also be stored in cache, and that's

86
00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:30.020
what that is.

87
00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:32.520
Post-compiled information that's been

88
00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.500
read from other places that can be

89
00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:35.340
stored on disk

90
00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:38.240
because it's not considered the authoritative

91
00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:39.040
source of truth.

92
00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:40.680
I just need a copy of this

93
00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.180
data stored in some place where I

94
00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:43.860
can get access to it later without

95
00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:45.880
consuming a whole bunch of other resources

96
00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:47.720
and processes trying to write that

97
00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:48.420
data back

98
00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:48.900
to disk.

99
00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:50.500
This is why you can have a

100
00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.760
device that's got 16 gigabytes of

101
00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:55.720
memory and a terabyte's worth

102
00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:56.780
of storage.

103
00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:58.420
This is also why IT people might

104
00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:59.700
be getting upset with you over the

105
00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:00.340
fact that you don't

106
00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:02.060
clarify the difference between storage

107
00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:03.160
and memory.

108
00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:04.520
It's not the same.
