1
00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:03.040
So, let's talk about how the inside

2
00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:04.040
of your computer works.

3
00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:06.140
See, a lot of people kind of

4
00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:07.060
sort of have this misconception.

5
00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:09.860
They seem to think that storage and

6
00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:12.120
memory is all the same thing, when

7
00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:13.460
in reality, it

8
00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:13.800
isn't.

9
00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.000
Let's get into that.

10
00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:17.480
Storage is what is stored on disk,

11
00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.240
and if I were to equate this

12
00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:20.860
to how a human was to

13
00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:23.140
behave, I would say it's your long

14
00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:23.840
-term storage.

15
00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:25.960
This is what you remember from your

16
00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:30.960
past, from last winter, COVID, those

17
00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:31.620
kinds of things.

18
00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:35.120
Anytime you're needing to recall that

19
00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:37.220
information in order to recite some

20
00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:38.380
kind of speech you

21
00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:40.500
may have recorded, or these words

22
00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.860
that I'm speaking right now, as I

23
00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:43.740
try to present this

24
00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:45.400
information to you, that's information

25
00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:47.540
that's stored in those frontal lobes,

26
00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:48.280
where you

27
00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:50.220
keep that information local, quick

28
00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:52.300
and easy to access, and it doesn't

29
00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:53.180
require much thought

30
00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:54.380
for you to be able to come

31
00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:55.260
off the top of the head for

32
00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:55.980
these kinds of things.

33
00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:57.900
That's what's called your memory,

34
00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:00.540
or your RAM, random access memory.

35
00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:04.280
Information that's stored long time

36
00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:06.100
when the computer is turned off is

37
00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:07.120
stored on the disk.

38
00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.020
Information that is stored within

39
00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:11.860
the memory disappears when the computer

40
00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:12.900
gets turned off.

41
00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:14.800
That information is not preserved.

42
00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.740
Why?

43
00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:17.660
It's because it's stored based on

44
00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:19.020
electricity circuits that are being

45
00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.220
kind of sort of cached

46
00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.640
or held within a low latency diode

47
00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:26.500
inside of the chip itself.

48
00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.780
These actually store bits that can

49
00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:31.420
be, you know, magnetically retrieved

50
00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:32.840
later, and the

51
00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:33.380
way this...

52
00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:34.500
Alright, I'm getting too technical.
