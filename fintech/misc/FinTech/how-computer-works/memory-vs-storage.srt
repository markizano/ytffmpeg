1
00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:03.580
Did you know, storage and memory,

2
00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:05.600
they're not the same thing.

3
00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:07.720
As far as the insides of your

4
00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:09.900
computer is concerned, storage is

5
00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.640
where long-term information

6
00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:12.220
is stored.

7
00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:14.280
This is where you get to download

8
00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.740
your files and your memories reside

9
00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:17.800
in your mind from

10
00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:21.400
last winter and COVID and all these things.

11
00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:24.080
Did you know that memory is where

12
00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:26.280
information must be loaded from disk

13
00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:27.080
before it can do

14
00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:28.540
anything inside of a computer?

15
00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:31.020
Yeah, and they used to call it

16
00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:33.700
RAM, which stands for Random Access Memory.

17
00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:35.760
If you're looking for hardware chips,

18
00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:37.600
that's what you'll be looking for

19
00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:38.380
at least anyways.

20
00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:41.580
Yes, information is loaded from disk

21
00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:44.560
to memory, and this can be a

22
00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:46.100
really expensive operation.

23
00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:48.320
I mean, this can cost a lot

24
00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:50.340
of time in a computer program.

25
00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:52.580
And then we wonder why we get

26
00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:54.520
that loading screen all the time.

27
00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:57.240
Once things finally do make it into

28
00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:58.720
memory, they get processed by the

29
00:00:58.720 --> 00:00:59.980
processor, the CPU,

30
00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.360
the central processing unit.

31
00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:03.000
Some say this is the brain of

32
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.620
the computer, but I like to think

33
00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:06.940
of it as the active tubules

34
00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:07.580
that go off.

35
00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:09.940
The brain of the computer, in my

36
00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:11.720
head, is at least in the kernel

37
00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:12.760
where the decisioning

38
00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:14.560
is being made in the software.

39
00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:17.000
The CPU is kind of sort of

40
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.500
like the hardware rails that represents

41
00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.080
what the capacity of

42
00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.680
the computer could do, similarly to

43
00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:24.240
a person.

44
00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.240
If I put a program in there

45
00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:27.680
that only uses a couple of seconds

46
00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.880
of CPU cycles, well, it

47
00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:32.200
doesn't matter how powerful that CPU

48
00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.360
is, that program is only going to

49
00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:35.140
consume that much.

50
00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:37.820
So I must create a program that

51
00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:40.100
must consume the full capacity of

52
00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:41.440
that processor if I'm

53
00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:44.040
going to take advantage of the hardware

54
00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.040
that has been given to me.

55
00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:48.280
And then of course there's the GPU,

56
00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:49.280
the graphics card.

57
00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:51.820
This is typically responsible for

58
00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:54.300
rendering what happens inside of your

59
00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:55.400
screen as far

60
00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:57.020
as your graphics is concerned, however,

61
00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:59.680
we're starting to find a lot more

62
00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:00.360
uses for these

63
00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.940
things since they have an incredibly

64
00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:05.020
dense computing capacity.

65
00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.780
I think mining AI and gaming are

66
00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:11.160
just the tip of the iceberg as

67
00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.960
far as what this kind

68
00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:14.960
of computing power could bring to us.

69
00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:17.860
Yeah, memory and storage are not the

70
00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:19.520
same thing, so if you're wondering

71
00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:20.060
why you're being

72
00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:21.800
corrected, now you know.
