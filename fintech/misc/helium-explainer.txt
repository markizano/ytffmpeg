<h1>Helium, A History</h1>

<h2>What is Helium Mining?</h2>
Mining with Wi-Fi.

How does Helium Mining work? Helium mining uses radio wave technology compared to conventional 
crypto mining, which relies on powerful gear such as ASICs or GPUs. As a result, it uses a lot less 
energy than traditional crypto-mining techniques.

Low latency
Low bandwidth
Constant access to Internet.
Beacons used to transmit small packets of data.

Trackers and other users of the network would come with HNT tokens.

HNT tokens would be used to transmit info like Geolocation and other metrics to the target server.

Used to be able to build your own.
(not sponsored) Bobcat, Nebra, and MNTD took up the helm on building boxes that were pre-built.
Manufacturing and shipping were a nightmare. I waited nearly 10 months for the delivery of my Bobcat
miner. I was so excited to get into it, I bought a 2nd miner and it's sitting at a friend's house.

After it's all said and done, I paid some odd $450 for each miner and now you can find them on the
2nd hand market for almost $100 and fresh ones may be shipping for as low as $200.

They originally had their own blockchain, but have since migrated to Solana.

I am currently sitting on maybe $30 in HNT tokens and probably $8 in their IOT tokens.

They started offering a 5G alternative so you could provide and support 5G right there in your home.
However, I never got to acquire one of these (kinda deflated after losing so much before on other
crypto ventures).

My take on Helium is that it was a great concept, but poor implementation.

I would have liked to see more of this expand into regular Wi-Fi networks and supporting high-bandwidth
stuff. I didn't like that it was so token focused and it seems that has settled now that the rewards
are in the hands of the few validators and the workers get the scraps leftover as per the usual.
