So, welcome to Kizano and LT's podcast. I don't know what else to call it. I'll figure 
out the name whenever we get to it. We're going to talk about polyamory, BDSM, and challenges the 
LGBT community is facing in this space. One of the topics that I wanted to talk about today 
includes one of the things that we see that is just so often and so frequent in the community is so 
many people are coming from these straight environments where the idea that has been sold to them 
that has been hammered into their heads is that they need to find that perfect woman and get a 
house and have two and a half children and that just doesn't work for everybody and we don't 
exactly have a framework in place to help us better understand how something like that is going to 
be possible for us. So, we just wanted to get together and have conversations and talk about, share 
our experiences in the hopes that others will be able to better understand and use this to benefit 
themselves for whatever that idea of beautiful suits them. Just to get it kicked off. In my 
experiences, I tried. I went down that path of, is it possible to try and recreate that for myself 
in a gay world? And I realized it isn't. It isn't possible to create the same thing. It's got to be 
a different image, or at least so I've experienced. I do think there's a place for monogamy in the 
LGBT community, but I think we also need to acknowledge that the idea of the house with the white 
picket fence and all that is a heteronormative idea. And we're not heteronormative. So, even in a 
monogamish or monogamy situation, it's not the same thing. So, what I'm experimenting with right 
now, what I'm challenging in my mind is whether or not, why always just one? And what is it with 
that seeking the one? And in my experiments, I've discovered that I think I have about a capacity 
of about six of people that I have the capacity to have a genuine relationship with and be able to 
spend a reasonable amount of time that feels like I can be happy with that person, no one person 
feels deprived of time from me, and I get to experience life with different people as part of a 
family unit that I've created. And I've realized that this is something that is not easy. 
Everybody's got to be individual of their own mind, because if there's any codependency in this, 
then it just becomes a black hole and everybody ends up taking care of it. And so that's not the 
shape that I'm willing to design as I'm trying to plan all this together and try and put it 
together. And also, I just set a clear expectation that all of this is an experiment. I don't 
exactly know what I'm doing. And as I read and understand more, as I learn more, I can help them 
teach that. And anyone that's willing to join with me on this journey of whatever it is we're 
trying to put together, whatever that version of happy is, it's something you have to find for 
yourself. What we're doing is we're trying to create families in our own way. We're not going to 
have necessarily two people come together and have the kids and grow a family. Ours comes more from 
our connections within the community. And I see yours right now more as branching out, but not 
necessarily at home. Where mine tends to be more at home and branches out from there. So it's kind 
of a different direction, but we're still going in the same manner, it's just we're going about it 
a little bit differently. I think it's awesome that you can just figure out what works for you and 
not feel like one way is better than the other. It's just whatever makes you happy. It took a while 
to get to this point, though. I didn't set out and say, this is how my family is going to be 
structured. It did take some experimentation and understanding of what I'm capable of and who I'm 
capable of doing it with. I've got a very good family. Of course, it's not just sexual. It is 
strong connections and bonds. There's the people that are in my inner circle that are really close 
and there's people that are a little bit out. But still, there's a bond there. So there's kind of, 
I guess, a ranking system. There's people with higher priority and people with lower priority, not 
that they matter less. At some point, I have to decide who gets top priority and who gets a little 
bit less. Because I can't give everybody top priority. I was watching somebody on TikTok and he was 
talking about a This brings up a critical polyamory topic. A prescriptive hierarchy is when you 
state very clearly that you have primary partners that take priority over secondary partners. A 
descriptive hierarchy is when you naturally have certain commitments and obligations to some 
partners and not others, regardless of your stated hierarchy. A declarative hierarchy and a 
descriptive hierarchy. So there's a difference between the two in that a declarative hierarchy, you 
just kind of allow it to take its place and people just sort of fit in where they fit in. And a 
prescriptive or declarative-descriptive type of hierarchy is one where you say, this is the primary 
relationship. Your second, your third, your fourth kind of thing. There comes a point, though, 
where it's just more than just the self. Relationships are work. They take commitment. And my 
relationships are important to me. So if I'm introduced to a new person and something is building, 
I still have to say, this is what I need. This is what I need for my family. I'm not going to take 
away from someone in my family to bring in someone new. They've got to be able to fit into where I 
exist. And I think that's hard for people to a degree, because my time is already limited. And a 
lot of times with new relationship energy, it's like, I want to be with you all the time. I want to 
do this. I want to do that. And I don't have that time. And I can sit there and I can tell you, I 
don't have all this time. I have other commitments that are important to me. I have to focus on 
those as well. This is what I have for you. And I find a lot of times that where I'm at now, that's 
just not enough. And that's okay. But it tends to go sideways and goes a little crazy. It's not an 
indictment against somebody. It's me protecting what I have. I'm discovering this because a lot of 
my connections are new. And we're currently in that phase. There's a few of us that are in that 
phase of, I'm enamored with you and I want to spend time with you and it feels really nice right 
now. And I'm like, wait for the fireworks to die down. Let's see how long this lasts. We're in the 
honeymoon phase. And a lot of people don't realize that initial time that you spend with somebody, 
as you're getting to know them, there's a honeymoon phase. It's going to feel amazing for the first 
year or two of them. Will it stand the test of time? And that's where I sit back and I say, I need 
to see you for all four seasons. If you really want it, you'll stick around. And too many people 
are looking for that diamond that just comes out of the box. That boyfriend that's ready made and 
it's like they don't exist. They don't. They don't. The one doesn't exist. I've heard that most 
people they might find 85, 90% and they round it up to one. There isn't the one. There's plenty of 
85, 90% out there. If there is only the one, no one would ever remarry or change partners at some 
point in their life because that one person is only hit. And if that were the case maybe that one 
person is on the other side of the world and you'd never meet them. I think another thing that 
people overlook is the idea of growing with somebody. Things feel really great and good right now, 
but as time goes on and as you become a different person, as you evolve, as you realize your pain 
may not be the same. You may pain about other things. You may evolve and grow and think about other 
things. Does that other person grow and evolve with you? And it's so liberating being away from the 
fear of whether or not that's going to happen because I can have a hope and a wish and a 
description. And for the first 20, 30 years of my life, it was the appeal towards and the fear of 
the loss of something that was precious towards me. But in the time that I've experienced loss at 
least more than a few times, I'm now at the point where I accept that loss is a part of life and to 
cherish the moments that you do have. There are seasons in life and not everybody is meant to have 
every season with you. And that's one of the hardest things is because you think forever, but 
forever has a really fucking long time. And a lot of shit can happen between now and next year. It 
can. I'm not sure that we are capable of becoming different people over time. I kind of see myself 
as I've always been who I am. I'm just more who I am today than I was before. I'm more focused on 
who I am. I'm more aware of who I am. But I don't think I'll ever truly know all of who I am. It 
does take exploration and personal thought. I don't think enough people give that thought and 
personal exploration that they should. Learning to understand yourself is not an easy task. No, 
indeed. I can tell you from experience. And as time shifts, we shift along with the time. So I 
could have been this label two years ago that I'm not today. But I'm still myself. I'm still the 
same person from two years ago. I'm still... I'm still that nut. Maybe a little more cracked. I'm 
not a different person. You can go through and reinvent yourself and everything, but the core of 
who you are sticks with you. It just gets more refined over time. That's what I believe. I'm kind 
of curious about what your thoughts are on gay marriage. It's a heteronormative idea, and I think 
it's a nice idea from a legal standpoint. But I'm not so sure it makes sense with our community. 
Well, let's start with marriage, as opposed to gay marriage. Because in my eyes, I never saw 
marriage as something that I aspired towards. For me, marriage looked like a financial contract and 
nothing more. The promise of marriage, matrimony, I should say, that promise of, I'll spend the 
rest of my life with you, seems more like something you just agree to with the other person. And 
you fulfill that contract by living each day with that person. So if we're going to go to a 
courtroom that's for financial gain, we both must benefit. And those were kind of the gates that 
you'd have to pass in order for me to marry you. If it was beneficial for both of us financially, 
and it was worth the headache of going to the court and filing the paperwork. But that's my 
personal take on it. On a grander take, I would say if that's something that benefits you in such a 
way, then a marriage is also from that perspective no different than signing up for the NESCO or 
C-Corp. It just seems like another financial instrument from a money perspective. As far as the 
promise perspective of it is concerned, when it spans across more than just one person, that gets 
into kind of what we're talking about as far as the polyamory is concerned. It's the commitment 
that you make and meet to the people that are important in your life. There's definitely a 
difference between the personal commitment to somebody and the legal aspect. One of the primary 
things with marriage itself is the ability to be involved in the health care of the other person. 
That was a big deal for me and my spouse. Being locked out, especially with my family, from my side 
would be extremely possible. His family is a lot more accepting, so I don't think that would be a 
problem. You never know from the hospital perspective what they're going to come up with. And 
having that legal definition in place guarantees that we are there for each other in times of need.
But I can only do that with one person. Right. From that perspective, I would say that there needs 
to be a policy in place that says these are your, these are the people you disclose your financial 
information to, and you sign off on each of those persons to have access to your data. And, you 
know, that's your relationship with the hospital or whatever you can set that up before you go to 
the hospital for anything. And just make sure that that has been pre-established with the facility. 
It's more than just establishing that with the facility, to be honest. I've been through. In an 
ideal scenario. In an ideal scenario. But I know the hospital, they're looking out for themselves, 
as they should. They're looking out for the legalities of the, everyone involved. If the person in 
the hospital passes, then the family's potentially going after the hospital for what they didn't 
like. It is not the documents with the hospital that matters is what what was signed with the 
lawyer. And I know that, unfortunately, through personal experience. My mother, when she passed 
away she had a DNR. They would not honor the DNR unless I said to honor it. Because I was next in 
line and I was the person that wasn't happy was going to sue. They weren't worried about her 
because she wasn't going to survive. Right. It's a tough situation for the hospital to be in. I get 
it. It's unfortunate. But without the document from the lawyer that said I can make that decision. 
I don't know where we would have been. And it was a horrible decision to make. Horrible decision to 
make. Somebody of importance has to make that decision. Yes. And without the lawyers involved. The 
challenge that we're facing here in this conversation is the fact that you've got somebody in the 
hospital, they're hurt. You being the person that's been with them, caring for them, loving them is 
barred from being able to talk to them, just because you're not married to them or related to them. 
And there's the hospital liability aspect of it. And marriage is one of those utilities tools that 
is available within the legal system that allows someone to have access to the health aspect of 
things. But this is one of the things that I wanted to fix in OSHA, which was the health care 
aspect of it. A system where we're not using insurance companies, we're not paying for our own 
health care. They could also have the one touch off where you basically show some biometric data 
and give confirmation. And you now authorize such and such to have access to your encrypted medical 
information. Well, you can also one touch off and get into your records and update it such that 
such and such has access to your records. Your partner has access in the same way that another 
doctor would and that they'd be able to come in and make decisions on your behalf. And you can even 
specifically declare what permissions you want to grant them under which circumstances. So in an 
ideal setup, you would have those options. And the health care system in general, no matter what 
facility you went to, would be able to recognize that. And that kind of governance could be 
something that the hospital could lead the charge on. That could be independent of the grander 
legal system. It could be a branch of its own in kind of sort of its own state like way of 
self-governance kind of thing. Because doctors already use HIPAA. There's a limit to that because 
my primary is not my medical go to. Not by any means. It's my secondary. My secondary is involved 
and that's not protected by the marriage. And if I go to see the doctor, my secondary wants to go 
with me. Because he's that involved. And I'm okay with that. And because of HIPAA, I just have to 
say it's okay. But if I get to a point where I'm incapacitated, what happens then? Because my 
secondary is the one that knows everything as far as medical goes. And that's a part of the health 
care system that I see could be in need of repair. Because there's not enough people that go to the 
doctor and say, well, in case I fall unconscious for whatever reason, this is not what I want to 
have happen kind of thing. I don't think that the health care system in that respect is damaged. I 
think it's going back to heteronormativity. It doesn't accommodate LGBT very well. Especially the 
T. Yes. Especially the T. And health care needs people that are willing to go to be seen and 
treated. And treated with respect. And I've been connected to enough trans people to know that the 
respect isn't there. And, you know, even as myself, when I go to different forms, fill out the 
forms, a lot of times the only option for gender is male and female. Right. It doesn't necessarily 
give me the option that I want. And it certainly doesn't give the option for trans, especially from 
a medical perspective. Because it's important to know birth sex versus sex now. Right. In that 
respect. Right. That's important. And there's no, from what I've seen, method of conveying that. 
And oftentimes, you're in the room with a doctor and being misgendered. Exactly. And that's a hit 
on your identity. When your identity is aberrated, it puts you in a state of despair. It does, and 
it also goes back to trust. If you can't trust your doctor because your doctor is misgendering you. 
It's a thing. You know, I have good doctors. I don't know what would happen if I go to a hospital 
where I don't know the doctors or people they're treating. Exactly. Because they're not necessarily 
the same as what you see every day. Uh-huh. The systems that need to be there are not there. Right. 
And people in general don't seem to recognize trans. I mean, it was hard enough getting people to 
accept gay and lesbian. Because at first, the narrative was, oh, if it's two girls doing it, it's 
okay. But not if it's two guys. And now people are like, well, fine, whatever. Have fun with 
whoever you want. But now that people are realizing and understanding, again, it seems that there 
are people that maybe spiritually have been misplaced in their body. Or somehow through life they 
realize they are of a different gender and want to identify themselves as such. That's agency of 
self. Everyone should have that. Everyone should be able to maintain that agency of self. And for 
anyone to try and force their own image of themselves onto someone else, I feel, is an injustice. 
That kind of idea is, I can't say outlawed, because you can't get rid of the idea. But discouraged 
may be a better way. In order to say, look, if somebody wants to change their gender, let them go 
about it. Let them find their own happiness. And how dare you take that person's happiness away 
from them. It has nothing to do with you. It doesn't impede you in any way. You don't have to have 
anything to do with it. So why is it so important that somebody else has a different vision of 
happiness than yourself? That doesn't involve hurting people. Because some people can be like, oh, 
well, my version of happiness is whipping somebody else in shackles and making them pick my corn 
for me. That's my happiness, right? No, that doesn't work that way. That's not happiness. That's 
enslavement. So I just want to build things in a way that gears us more towards the default of 
thank you for being here. I don't care who you are, what you choose, or what goes on, however you 
want to live your life to make it happy and beneficial to other people. However you want to go 
about that, thank you for being here. Let me give you the incentives to make that possible. And let 
me give you that love every day and let you know that you're appreciated. Because I don't think we 
have enough of that, of appreciation for the self, appreciation for our communities, appreciation 
for the little things that people go and do to make it possible for you to just walk down the 
street and get a burger out the window. And there are so many of us that are so upset and 
frustrated because you have to wait two or three extra minutes. Some people that feel so entitled 
that they just deserve to be treated like royalty but then act like spoiled brats. And I just don't 
understand why there are so many people that allow themselves to grow and grow up physically but 
stump themselves emotionally. And I aspire to change that by helping to educate people because I'm 
always striving to be better. And I struggle to see how it is you can go 30, 40, 50 years and not 
see some things and realize, yeah, I didn't know a lot. I think it's easy to be blind to things. I 
always say visibility matters. A lot of visibility in the LGBT community within ourselves. Beyond 
that, it's whatever the garbage they put on TV. Yes. And there is some good that TV has done as far 
as sharing who we are. But a lot of it stems originally from our being the villain, our being the 
bad guy. And it's not an accurate portrayal. We're just not understood. So things like this helps 
expand and explain who we are. And that's something that I didn't have growing up where today you 
can go on the Internet and find all kinds of conversations. Yeah. So there's all these 
contemplations and we're always fighting these heteronormative ideas. They're all around us. Yes. 
And all the subliminal programming and the messages and everything saying that you should do this 
this way. This is how you should live your life. I would say take those messages and say, hey, this 
is a way that could work. Instead of saying this is the way, this is their way. And if you want to 
go their way, you can go their way. But you should have the freedom and knowledge that you can 
choose anything you want, whatever it is you want. And with enough work, with enough time, with 
enough patience, you can create whatever picture in your mind. I do think it comes back to the 
heteronormativity, though. It's in our systems. It's all around us. When you want to do something 
your own way, you're still fighting that heteronormativity. And being a right-handed person. It 
never goes away. And there are people that just don't understand why you want anything different. 
They're blind to things. They've never seen it elsewhere. So why would it exist? And they don't 
understand why it doesn't work. In our relationships, when we build family, we're not protecting 
the children. We're not having the children. We're protecting ourselves. We're protecting 
ourselves. That's another aspect we could get into, is the man who is single, gay, been through so 
many things with so many different men, and is scared to feel anything for anybody else. Because to 
feel for anyone else is to implicate yourself, is to get involved, is to have a boyfriend, leads to 
this whole rabbit hole of shit that you probably don't want to get into. And so it's better to just 
fuck two or three times, and I'm done with you, I'll never see you again. Next. Vulnerability is 
hard. That's where the rewards are. It's hard. Letting your guard down when you've been beat down 
all through your childhood is hard. I don't know what school was like for you, but for me it was 
miserable. Everyone knew before I did. Yeah, exactly. Faggot Mark, Stupid Mark, Fucker Mark. You 
get the name calling, you get the bullying, you get all this stupid shit growing up, and it paints 
a vision of your world. It's hard to go out there and open yourself up when you've been beat down. 
But it's a necessity. You're never going to find anything deeper if you don't open yourself up, if 
you don't let the walls down. And for me, being able to let myself be who I am with my family is 
huge. I don't have to worry about anyone outside, because I've got people in my corner that matter.
I can relate to this. I don't share with you. That little piece of advice is amazing. I'm glad I
picked up on that from Mark Manson. It wasn't written in a way that addresses us specifically. It is
another heteronormative thing, but it applies. If I'm interested in you, you better be interested
in me as well, because I'm not going to waste my time otherwise. That can change with people over 
time, too. Maybe you're interested today, but not tomorrow, or vice versa. It's an ongoing thing. 
It's not a one-time decision. You need to know your own self-worth. I know from my younger years, 
and I see it all the time, we get out of high school, we maybe go to college, we're starting to do 
our own life, and we feel like we have to go get that partner. We have to have that boyfriend, we 
have to have that spouse, we have to have whatever, because that defines us. And it doesn't. It 
absolutely does not. We have to know our own self-worth first. Anything else that comes on is a 
benefit. It's not a definer. I know from my early years, I went to the wrong relationships. I 
didn't have the background to know what a healthy relationship was in the first place. And I went 
into all the wrong relationships, because I wanted that love, I wanted that thing to define me. And 
it just doesn't work that way. Another one of the things I learned was someone who is not given 
that unconditional love at a very young age, oftentimes spends the rest of their life seeking to 
have that love fulfilled for them. And I can't help but think to times in my life where it's like, 
damn, if I had just got that unconditional love as a kid, and knew how to appreciate myself growing 
up, I'd be a completely different person and would be in a completely different place. I'd probably 
be a millionaire by now. But I'm not, because I thought I would fall in love, and I thought that 
person would make things better. But there is no silver lining. There is no boyfriend in a box 
that's going to pop up out of nowhere and just suddenly save the day for you. That doesn't just 
happen. And rightfully so, anyone who does, you should be skeptical of them. Rightfully so. My 
friends are. Everyone who is in my circle is very skeptical of me. Yes, you should be. But I'm also 
very genuine in the aspect of it, and I'm very patient with it, because I understand that these 
things, I have learned also relationships are forged over time. And I say forged because they come 
out of volcanic ash. OK, they're not instant pop in the microwave in a hot pocket. I'm sorry if 
your relationship is a hot pocket, honey. Yeah, shut the damn door. No, they are forged over time, 
and they do take work. And it has to be work you are willing to put in. And if you want to be 
better in life, it has to be something that serves and benefits you as well. So you've got to do 
the work. There's there's an aspect of that where something else I wanted to touch on was the daddy 
aspect of it, because there is a lot of older men in the gay community that are sitting here. Why 
are these younger guys so into me? And the younger guys are coming out of their situations going, I 
never got a daddy. So they're looking for their daddy. That is that is actually quite interesting, 
and it goes beyond just that. Daddy is more a thing here in the States than it is in Europe. And 
part of that is because of the AIDS crisis here. The Republicans laughed. And they let people die. 
They let a whole generation of gay men die. So there's a gap. And if you're into older men, which I 
always was, still kind of am. I'm on both ends of the spectrum now. You know, it was not uncommon 
for me in my early 20s to date someone 14 years older than me. In my whole life, I've been dating 
people twice as much. There were great relationships. I still connect with some of those people, 
not on the same level, but I'm still friends with people that I used to see in my 20s. But, you 
know, if you're into older men and this whole generation is gone, you go older. And and daddy is a 
thing here because we went through that experience where in Europe they didn't have. The 
politicians laughing at people dying. It's not so strong of a thing over there. And it doesn't 
resonate over there. And I've seen it. I do travel. But there is a wisdom that is supposed to come 
from daddy. There's there's there's a period of time that I'm aware of that younger people don't 
know today. And you can watch things like Pose and kind of get an idea, but it's foreign to people. 
And I say that with a grain of salt because my pup and I watch Pose and he doesn't know the time 
frame, but he does know the POC point of view. So there is a level of connection there. He doesn't 
know the time. He doesn't understand. For those that don't know POC, person of color. He does not 
understand the period of time. I was not in New York City at the time. I was very close to New York 
City. And it is so. I'm too familiar with. Even though, you know, it wasn't my people in the show, 
but I know exactly what that time period was. Yeah. Well, and I've always been involved with POC. 
So there's that side of that that I don't personally identify with, but it's there. Exactly. So 
daddy is very complicated. I don't think people understand how complicated it truly is. Well, then 
maybe my argument might sound a little naive in speaking out. The idea was that there's these boys 
that are having these things with their daddies. And I wonder about this. Would I be different if I 
had a better relationship with my father growing up? Would these boys have better relationships 
with women and be able, you know, would there be less gay people on the planet if we had better 
daddies? That's what I'm trying to say. You know, the heteronormative crew wants to sit up here and 
bash us for being gay. And it's like, yeah, but what kind of a father were you? And what kind of 
incentive did you give to me to be straight, to want to have children, to want to prolong the 
family name? What incentive did you give me to want to do that? Because I didn't get any incentive. 
I got, you know, kind of chucked off to the side like I don't matter. You should have killed me 
when I was a baby or even not had me in the first place. That's how you're going to feel about it. 
There's a resentment that I have in myself towards my upbringing. Because it's like I didn't get 
that appreciation growing up. And so now that I finally found love for myself and I'm capable of 
providing that towards myself, I find myself now being a projection of what it was I was missing. 
And so now I'm showing nothing but gratitude towards those around me. So there's this fork in the 
road where it's like, yeah, I probably would be a different person. But who knows what I still have 
the gratitude and appreciation I have today. Would I be straight? Would I be as grateful? Oh, the 
possibilities. I don't think you'd be straight. I think you are who you are. It might be a choice 
between living your true self or not. Well, I've made comments about this in the past, and it 
sounds really dark, but there's somewhat of a humorous aspect of it. Raising a daddy is like 
raising a boy in reverse. I mean, as he gets older, he starts losing his sense and starts turning 
back into a little teenager. And then at some point, you put the pacifier back in him and then he's 
back in diapers. And then you put him back in his cradle. But which one do you put in the pacifier? 
I guess that depends on his treatments. On a happy note. I think so. Yeah. Well, this has been
