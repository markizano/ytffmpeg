# Introduction
In today's busy world of hustle and bustle, we seem to have become lost in the sauce of life.
Many of us are detracted, detatched or otherwise disconnected from one another, life, our systems
and our planet. Also, in today's media, there's a lot of talk about these problems,
but not nearly enough action, let alone any direction. I am putting this essay together to hopefully
leave behind some breadcrumbs of my work in improving this in whatever ways I can. If I can touch
an individual, a nation or a system, I will have done my job if I can leave this place better
than I found it. In my life and in my entire cycle, I want to provide and derive a much better place
and want to use and consume all the resources it would take to sustain me until the end and leave
nothing behind in a big puddle or mess, barring an assasination, fatal incident or other recourse
that would otherwise prevent me from accomplishing my goals in life. With this, I hope to write my
obituary. When people talk about me, one day, I want them to say "well, he accomplished his goals
and that included improving on these 6 foundational points." -- of course, that's very high-level
and very aspirational, but aim for the stars and hopefully, you'll at least land on the moon, right?


In this essay, we'll explore six major pain points I see in the world around me today that I would
like to see improved by some form or fashion. If it were physically possible, I would personally
work towards improving these things myself, but that's not feasible, nor probable. What is possible
is providing enough influence that causes a shift in the system to derail us from this crash course
of the planet burning up in some way or another to a society that has since evolved and ascended
beyond primal instinct. We are conscious creatures after all with intelligence, so why are we
catering our every motion to those who have the least intelligence instead of increasing their
capacity for accomplishing more. Because when you win, I win. When we win, the world gets better,
right?

I have 6 major points I want to discuss in this essay:
- Waste Management
- Incarciration and the Penal System
- Education
- Governance vs Politics
- Finance
- Healthcare

In this essay, we'll review the current waste management systems of our society, what that is and
how we can improve it. We'll explore the penal system, how incarciration is immoral and explore some
ideas on how we can flip this system on its head to be a productive means to improving human lives
rather than detaining them in a box because that's so healthy. We'll take a look at the education
system and explore how that can improve as well since our children seem to be getting dumber by the
generation. We'll explore how useless Government has become and think of new ways to govern the
people in a non-intrusive way that evaluates facts, figures and details on how things improve,
rather than the rigged popularity contest it has become for big money grabbers and system-gamers.
This leads nicely into our financial aspect of things and see how that can be improved (tl;dr:
I hate money). Finally, we'll explore the healthcare system and find ways of improving that as
well.

I'll caveat that this is just a multi-part plan that involves many moving parts. I don't have all
the answers. I don't know all the things. I may have some things wrong in this post. I am not God.
I damn sure as hell am not your dad. I am not the coming of the second Jesus and so if you
approach me with this... think again. I'm human just like you and a regular guy just like you.
A recurring theme and element thru all of this will also reflect upon the self since I believe a
lot of the anger, malice and hatred in this world today stems from the self. If the phrase "You
can't love another until you love yourself." rings true, then it would be a fair assessment to
say that if you are effective in hating yourself, you are equally capable of hating others.

# Waste
Where's the Atomizer?!

In today's world, "Waste Management" just means moving the dump of trash from one location to
another. There's no processing of trash after that, or at least the part that goes to Landfills.
It is a good thing that we at least have systems in place that try to parse out the reusable or
compostable items. However, I do have a concern for waste that is otherwise unable to be reused.
In today's environment, the issue I take is with the fact that it's 2023 and we haven't come up
with a way of completely or mostly recycling our waste to the point that companies are making money
from the waste produced and the energy that can be reclaimed from re-consuming our waste in
creative ways until we are able to bruteforce it with the Atomizer.

Why do we use this "Plastic" substance that is absolutely wretched for the environment, highly toxic,
and gets into everything including our food? In today's environment, "Waste Management" just means the
trash truck comes to get your trash once a week, maybe. We, as humans, produce so much waste in
almost everything we do, it should be illegal. Cardboard boxes being used for shipments without an
easy to use process by which they can be reclaimed and re-used in the supply chain systems.

The Atomizer is a futuristic device that enables the transformation of product materials down to
their base elements or close to it such that the results can be re-used to create a new product.
In futuristic novels, it may very well be a single product that is able to transfigure matter
into other matter. In reality, it will most likely start off as a process (as it is today) and
evolve into more refined components that collectively create "The Atomizer" as a Machine. At first,
elements of the Atomizer may be inefficient and consume more energy than its worth to break the
components down. However, after enough trials, work and effort on Humans' behalf, it could be
possible to create something more efficient. Demand would also be of concern here, in that we
would need to support the capacity of the human race's waste when constructing these processes
and machines.


# Penal System
As it stands today: When you do something wrong and we don't know what else to do with you, we put
you in a box for some time with other crazy people. You are now tainted, branded and will forever
carry this "social noose" around your neck for the rest of your life. No matter what you do, if
you make the wrong mistake, it'll sit with you for the rest of your life.

I don't agree with this "Life Tax" or that you should perpetually pay for a mistake for the rest
of your life. In my eyes, mistakes are simply learning experiences. They are chances to do better.
Opportunities to learn and grow. Our correction facilities should reflect this and focus on how
one can love the Self enough to be respectable and respectful when engaging with society.

Those that are in the penal system for drugs or other pharmaceuticals are not criminals, they are
patients and they need help to get away from these substances. This includes a full circumstantial
change from their environment, access, pattern of life and everything else that comes with it.
Folks just do not understand how these substances can mess with your mind to make you incredibly
irrational. You think it's a decision, but what if the drug itself makes you change your decision?
Not everybody is as strong and we should forgive ourselves and others for falling into this trap.
The best we can do is abstain and help others reach a place where they don't feel like they need
to do this in order to "fit in" or "numb the pain" or whatever other social reason that started
them down this path. We need to do better as a society of forgiving ourselves when we make a mistake
and course correct rather than completely reject if we are going to be the all-caring society
we seek to become. We can also change the stigma around folks who don't drink. I am noticing
some of this take place in my personal world, so I am happy for that. However, I will be happy
to see this become a more greater adoption for folks that don't partake in any mind altering
substances like coffee and alcohol.


# Education
The education system is far to top-heavy. There are far too many soul-sucking executives involved in
the mix that add very little to children's education, but take all the weath that comes from money
we invest in our children. Our tax dollars shouldn't be spent on making the executives above the
principal rich, it should be spent on supplies, lunches, student teacher and parent therapy, LIVING PAY.
That money being spent on the executives could be spent on learning scientists that try to understand
and develop more efficient ways of getting people to learn and engage with the learning process
to understand what's most efficient. We can also consider what's beneficial to us over time by
understanding more about the social attributes of society that departs from school and how they
evolve and grow.

# Government
The two party system of America has got to be the most disgusting creation of man because it's the
never ending war that will do nothing but divide a nation into polar opposites with no sense of
balance or order. Instead of a popularity constest that's easily exploited via how much money you
have, let's change it to a system where there's actual job descriptions associated with roles that
require a person to be present to complete the job for the sake of the people. I want to be able to
say that I am proud of my Government because it takes care of its people, but clearly that's not the
case with capitalistic nepotism ruining the fabric of policy and financial structure.

This segways quite nicely into my next point ....


# Finance
The financial system could use an overhaul. Personally, I think the whole system of money could be
removed and we instead think about the laws of physics and focus on what's physically possible rather
than what is financially possible. However, this isn't a very popular idea since exchange of value
over a common denominator somehow gives us the warm fuzzies at night to lead us to the man-created
illusion that we are exchanging something of the equivalent value.

In the meantime, there are some things that Blockchain technology can do to help improve this. Namely,
around transparency, finality, and validity. It would be great if the exchanges were completely
transparent and posted all inflows, outflows, trades and options against every order they got from
their customers (possibly en-aggregate), but we are a long way from this level of transparency.
The same goes for the stock market and all trades that take place on the public market.

# Healthcare
With as much money citizens pay into the tax system and that is expensed in the many places it gets
disbursed, I don't see an issue with 

# Conclusion
Look, I get it -- this is a lot to take in, there's a lot more to research. There needs to be an
additional installment to this as more data is collected and more things are actually done in these
areas. I cannot do this alone, but I also cannot scour for every resource on this alone either.
Let's see if we can turn some gears in this direction. I am willing to put a company behind it and
stand behind that company for this.

My conslusion from all of this is it stems from the hatred of the self and the pain of the self that
we all endure. We don't cultivate environments where it's easy to love the self, let alone take care
of it. I speak these terms from the stance of "Do unto others as you would have them do unto you."
or more specifically: Be reasonable with yourself and others. We are all trying to do our best in society
and our laws, policies, practices, teachings and preachings should consider this when laying down
the rules of the land. Personally, I call them guidelines rather than rules. I like to honour guidelines
and show strength in being able to make a decision on the spot even if some of the ideals conflict
with each other. It shows flexibility rather than rigidity in the thinking to allow for exception
cases. Rules seem very ridgid in their design, therefore, they would do better served as a result of
a pattern being set rather than an enclosed idealism that must be strictly adhered or else negative
reinforcement would be applied.
